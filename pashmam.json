        "explain": "&lt;p&gt;The energy transition and the electrification of the heating and transport sectors will require a more active participation of the demand side to balance fluctuating renewable energy supply with demand and reduce the need for grid expansion. In addition, the energy crisis has revealed important shortcomings in the current design of electricity tariffs. Customers paying real-time prices have experienced excessive bill increases that led to regulatory interventions in the form of compensations. Customers on fixed-price contracts, on the other hand, had insufficient incentives to reduce their load.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Future-proof electricity tariffs should provide a solution to all these challenges. They should protect customers from excessive price peaks but still retain incentives for demand response and enable customers to specify the amount of flexibility which they are able to provide and ensure that this flexibility is used optimally. In addition, the regulation for retailers needs to be revised, to enable competition without undermining the incentives to hedge against increasingly volatile prices.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Sigurd Bjarghov, PhD&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;SINTEF Energy Research, Trondheim, Norway&lt;br&gt;(grid tariff design, demand response, market design, local flexibility markets)&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Christine Gschwendtner, PhD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard University, Cambridge, USA&lt;br&gt;(electrification, flexibility, demand-side management, distribution grids)&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. David Ribo-Perez, PhD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management, TU Delft, Delft, Netherlands&lt;br&gt;(electricity market design, electricity tariffs, consumer-centered energy systems, flexibility)&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Tim Schittekatte, PhD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sloan School of Management, MIT/Florence School of Regulation, Cambridge, USA&lt;br&gt;(regulation, power markets, energy economics)&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Christian Winzer, PhD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Center for Energy and Environment, School of Management and Law, Zurich University of Applied Sciences/ZHAW, Zurich, Switzerland&lt;br&gt;(electricity tariffs, grid tariffs, market design, demand response)&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Selin Yilmaz, PhD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Department of Energy Efficiency, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland&lt;br&gt;(electricity tariffs, flexibility, demand response, governance, social acceptance)&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special issue information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Electricity tariffs are becoming a critical policy issue as the needs to electrify demand increase and our distribution networks reach unprecedented levels of congestion. The expected new loads comprise heat pumps, electric vehicles, rooftop solar, and batteries. While previous demand was rather inflexible, these new distributed energy resources can behave flexibly and provide some of the flexibility that is needed to accommodate renewables and defer network investments. Future electricity tariffs should aim to facilitate this role while providing the necessary protection for vulnerable consumers from the full risk of volatile electricity prices. The high policy relevance of tariff design is underlined by the responses of ACER and ENTSO-E to the EU consultation on future market design, both of which highlighted tariff design as a key topic for future reforms, as well as by the large amount of ongoing research in response to the energy crisis (see &lt;a href=\"https://www.esig.energy/aligning-retail-pricing-with-grid-needs/\"&gt;White-Paper Series&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://pure.uvt.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/65524792/CERRE_Retail_Energy_Markets_Under_Stress.pdf\"&gt;Report1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://ceepr.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MIT-CEEPR-RC-2023-01.pdf\"&gt;Report2&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The Special Issue “Future Electricity Tariffs” aims to improve the design and implementation of electricity tariffs. Tariffs results from a complex decision-making process as different objectives (cost recovery, efficiency, simplicity, and transparency...) tend to conflict with each other and different consumer groups may be affected in different ways by different designs. The process should therefore be addressed and analysed with a transdisciplinary approach to deal with all issues arising (quantitative, qualitative, policy design, design of indicators...). We invite submissions on the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Grid charges, energy charges and interactions between them&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Distribution network tariffs&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Congestion management mechanisms at the distribution level&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Tariffs for different security levels (or service priority)&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Different approaches for risk hedging&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Retail competition and rules for tariff switching&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Financial hedging requirements for suppliers and other regulatory aspects&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Attractiveness of tariffs for users&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manuscript submission information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;You are invited to submit your manuscript at any time before the submission deadline of &lt;strong&gt;July 31, 2023&lt;/strong&gt;.

        "explain": "&lt;p&gt;Household energy consumption and climate change are highly related. On the one hand, residential energy sector has become a major energy consumption sector, responsible for significant emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) (Mi et al., 2020). According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) data, residents consumed 21% of global total final energy in 2019 (IEA, 2022). On the other hand, climate change has impacts on household energy consumption. Global temperature rise will increase energy demand for cooling and decrease energy demand for heating. In addition, household energy consumption is known to affect human well-being and can result in harmful environmental impacts. Thus, understanding the changes and dynamics of household energy consumption as well as the associated greenhouse gas emission and environmental impacts at the global and regional level will be critical for achieving climate change mitigation targets.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prof. Dr. Zhifu Mi, PhD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;University College London, London, UK&lt;br&gt;(Climate change economics, energy policy, carbon neutrality)&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Lu Jiang, PhD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China&lt;br&gt;(Energy geography, regional sustainability, energy consumption)&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special issue information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Recent work has identified several critical factors that affect the consumption of household energy, including household characteristics, energy prices, and energy-related policies (Wolske et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2016). Therefore, the type and amount of household energy consumption are different within and across regions and nations. In the coming years, household energy transition requires further development to achieve policy objectives and function well in climate change mitigation (Mi et al., 2020).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The special issue “Household energy consumption and climate change” aims to improve understanding on the regional diversity and effects of relevance to energy consumption in our households. This issue will provide a platform for cross-cutting analyses that inform global, national and regional climate change mitigation targets. It will provide critical advices for key stakeholders such as policy makers, practitioner, industries and households. Hence, we invite submissions on the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;1.

        "explain": "&lt;p&gt;Rising energy and housing costs for poor households have fueled energy policy debate in recent years. The availability of affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy service are essential to sustain well-being, which is also a prerequisite for achieving SDG7 and specific other SDGs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Further, reliable access to energy services is crucial for reducing various forms of poverty and sustainable economic growth. Fuel poverty, conceptualized as the household's inability to meet its fundamental energy needs, is a pervasive issue in developing and developed economies (Kearns et al., 2019; Primc et al., 2019; Lin and Wang, 2020; Karpinska and Śmiech, 2020).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;While climate change looms large in undermining efforts to eradicate extreme poverty, ambitious climate policies could place a financial burden on the world's middle classes through higher food and energy prices.Achieving sustainability goals and effectively limiting global warming necessitate aggressive decarbonization of industrialized countries, but also leaves relatively limited space for energy growth. However, the ability of developing nations to improve the living standards of the world's poor under these conditions is a critical concern.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fateh Belaïd&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center, Saudi Arabia&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ramzi Benkraiem&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Audencia Business School, France&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stéphane Goutte&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;UMI_SOURCE, University Paris-Saclay France&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khaled Guesmi&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;CRECC – Paris School of Business, France&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special issue information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;After the economic ravages of COVID-19, low-income countries are experiencing a more acute and long-lasting downturn that has increased poverty around the world and reversed recent trends in reducing inequality. According to the World Bank estimations, between 88 and 115 million people fell into extreme poverty in 2020, and this figure will reach between 119 and 124 million in 2021 (WB, 2020). Further, fuel poverty is associated with cold homes and adverse health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The challenge of addressing fuel vulnerability and poor energy efficient home-related negative health impacts is fundamental to improving the quality of life of many households by making their homes warmer and more efficient (Simshauser, 2021; Simshauser, 2021). Furthermore, reducing fuel poverty could substantially enhance health outcomes, reduce inequalities in health, as well as make an essential contribution to tackling residential greenhouse emissions.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the growing body of knowledge regarding fuel poverty assessment and the main factors driving fuel poverty phenomenon, gaps in the evidence remain (Bélaïd, 2018). Further research is required to investigate the fuel poor's attitudes to energy efficiency and how they perceive their energy situation (Kearns et al., 2019).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Within this context, this special issue's primary purpose is to amalgamate the high-quality research work on fuel poverty and energy vulnerability. The focus will be on the challenges, strategies, and lessons learned in recent years both in developing and developed countries. This special issue's specific objective is to understand the role of energy prices, housing characteristics, and socio-economic features in shaping the fuel poverty phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;More precisely, it aims at providing an international overview of the many facets of fuel poverty, including domestic energy consumption, well-being, behavioral change, and energy efficiency deployment as an instrument for fuel poverty mitigation. To derive policy discussion/recommendations, the special issue will contain state-of-art policy, theoretical and empirical advances to examine and document fuel poverty's economic, health, and well-being implications.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;A very holistic vision is more than ever necessary to combine ambitious climate policies with effort to alleviate energy poverty. The special issue will discuss innovative approaches and key policy measures to optimize lessons learned in tackling energy poverty and leverage them as the backbone of resilient and well-being economic model. Besides helping to gain a comprehensive overview of the scope of the energy poverty phenomenon, the special issue may also act as a vector to stimulate public engagement and disseminate information and best practices among policymakers, public and private stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;One of the expected impact of the special issue is to help policy-makers and practitioners to navigate the global fuel poverty agenda, provide a map of existing works and case studies, and recommend promising avenues for future research. This will inform the energy policy-making process within the framework of the sustainable development goals objectives and the continuous energy system transformation. Further, the SI will provide a holistic examination of fuel poverty issues and challenges and how they are being addressed by identifying, diagnosing, and tackling these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Theoretical robustness, scientific innovation, and potential policy applicability to energy poverty alleviation are the three major criteria for a paper to be considered for publication. &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contributions to this special issue are expected to cover the following topics (but are not limited to):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;- Definition and energy poverty assessment- Exposure and risk to energy poverty: Examining the extent of the energy precariousness and its&lt;br&gt;predominant causal factors&lt;br&gt;- Climate policy and insights into energy poverty&lt;br&gt;- Ambitious climate policy with efforts to reduce energy poverty&lt;br&gt;- Energy poverty eradication in a carbon-constrained world&lt;br&gt;- Socio-economic inequalities in energy poverty before and during the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;br&gt;- Capacity and the energy-poor willingness to pay for improving their housing energy performance&lt;br&gt;- Impact of climate change policy on inequality and energy access&lt;br&gt;- The new era of the energy transition in the building sector&lt;br&gt;- Drivers and barriers of energy consumption and energy efficiency&lt;br&gt;- The role of energy efficiency in enhancing well-being and achieving sustainability goals&lt;br&gt;- Challenges, investment opportunities, financing and technological innovations in energy efficiency&lt;br&gt;- The role of uncertainty in shaping individual preferences for residential energy renovation decision&lt;br&gt;- The cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency implementation measures in the residential sector&lt;br&gt;- Energy poverty, health &amp; welfare benefits of energy efficiency&lt;br&gt;- Investment and individual preference for energy efficiency purchase decisions&lt;br&gt;- Economic Inequality and Household Energy Consumption&lt;br&gt;- Fuel poverty and energy policy: Challenges and solutions&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manuscript submission information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;You are invited to submit your manuscript from&lt;strong&gt; Jan 1st, 2023&lt;/strong&gt; until&lt;strong&gt; June 30th, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt;.

I coordinate the Sustainability Transformation programme area at my faculty. My research focuses on questions of social and environmental equity and justice along three main strands. The first concerns extractive zones, conflict regions and sites of dispossession. At this supply end of the energy spectrum, I explore issues of inequitable power relations and resource access in conjunction with the configuration and constitution of institutional authority.\\n\\nThe second concerns the political economy of the energy sector, and interrogates dynamics close to the supply-demand interface. Here, I have examined the governance of electricity distribution, and engage with questions of social imaginaries of energy, intra-household and community energy practices, and public engagement with decision-making on common energy futures, with an empirical basis in India, Portugal, Norway and elsewhere.\\n\\nThe third strand concerns questions of accountability and sustainability in energy transitions, with an empirical focus on solar uptake. I am keen to unpack claims of sustainability &ndash; understood as decarbonisation with an enhancing effect on social equity &ndash; associated with energy transitions and their contextual specificities. My work in this regard employs expert interviews, participant and field observation, small-scale surveys, and extended engagement with a wide range of sectoral stakeholders. This empirical effort is accompanied by a methodological ambition to study accountability as a means of characterising energy transitions in relation to their implications for sustainability.\\n &lt;a href=\"https://www.uis.no/en/profile/2327\"&gt;Editor's Personal Website&lt;/a&gt;"

She is an internationally recognized expert on renewable energy transformation, energy justice, climate justice, energy democracy, and gender and race in energy and climate.  Her most recent book, Diversifying Power: Why We Need Antiracist, Feminist Leadership (Island Press, 2020), inspires collective action by elevating the stories of innovative diverse leaders who are linking climate and energy with jobs and economic justice, health and food, transportation and housing.  She argues that the key to effectively addressing the climate crisis by mobilizing transformative change is to diversify leadership, redistribute wealth and power, and move beyond technocratic solutions so that feminist, antiracist priorities are at the core of all policy. Before Northeastern, Professor Stephens was on the faculty at the University of Vermont (2014-2016) and Clark University (2005-2014). She earned her PhD at Caltech in environmental science &amp; engineering and her BA at Harvard in environmental science &amp; public policy. During 2022-2023, she is on sabbatical in Dublin and London.  www.jenniecstephens.com   @jenniecstephens\\n &lt;a href=\"https://www.jenniecstephens.com/\"&gt;Editor's Personal Website&lt;/a&gt;"

        "explain": "&lt;p&gt;The world is facing enormous pressure towards carbon neutral. As a large energy consumer, the building field is also facing the urgent need of energy saving and CO2 emission reduction. At present, building energy consumption nearly accounts for one third of the global total energy consumption, and according to the International Energy Agency, the energy demand of buildings will grow by 30% in 2040, which will lead to a large amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission if use of renewable energy is not considered..&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The energy demand in buildings include heat, cooling and electricity, which can be efficiently fulfilled by clean solar energy technologies. Plenty of solar thermal, PV and hybrid PV/T systems have been integrated with buildings for energy supply. Matching of solar energy supply and building energy consumption, novel technologies, components and installations, as well as aesthetics &amp; applicability &amp; economy , there is a lot to explore on “Building-Integrated Solar Energy”.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This special issue includes the revised selected papers contributing to “&lt;strong&gt;Building-Integrated Solar Energy&lt;/strong&gt;” from the 3rd International Conference for Global Chinese Academia on Energy and Built Environment–CEBE2023. The “CEBE”conference was jointly initiated and organized by Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Southwest Jiaotong University, University of Colorado Boulder and University of Hull, aiming to establish a platform to share achievements in clean energy utilization, artificial environment energy efficiency improvement and environmental quality improvement. The conferences were held in Chengdu, China in 2019 and 2021. Over 1,300 Chinese scholars from around the world participated in the last session and over 1000 abstracts and about 600 full-length papers were collected. The 3rd “CEBE” conference is planned to be hosted by Shanghai Jiao Tong University and held on July 28-31, 2023 in Shanghai, China.

        "summary": "particle-based-solar-energy-capture-and-storage-for-concentrated-solar-power",
        "explain": "&lt;p&gt;Particle-based solar thermal energy storage (TES) coupled to concentrated solar power (CSP) is an attractive pathway towards operating at elevated temperatures while extending electricity production beyond diurnal periods of on-sun operation. Operation at elevated temperatures necessitates higher solar concentration ratios at MW&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;-scales that are only possible with power towers and heliostat fields. These elevated temperatures are facilitated by particle-based solar thermal energy storage systems due to effective absorptance of concentrated solar irradiation, chemical inertness, and thermal stability combined with high heat capacities. The operating principles of a TES integrated CSP system are direct or indirect heating of particles entering a solar receiver from cold storage tank via exposure to concentrated solar irradiation, which results in an increase in temperature as sensible heat is stored; transfer to a hot storage tank for use when required; conveyance and integration into a heat exchanger where the particle heat is transferred to a fluid drive a power cycle and produce on-demand electricity; and subsequent storage in a cold tank to complete the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Numerous advances have been made in particle-based solar TES integrated with CSP to make them less expensive, more efficient, and capable of longer continuous operation. A principal enabler has been extensive research and technology development of subcomponents, including solar receivers, storage tanks, and heat exchangers. The development of these technologies is supported by fundamental work aimed at determining key properties for understanding flows, heat and mass transfer, and particle attrition.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Professor Peter Loutzenhiser, Georgia Tech;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Professor Renkun Chen, UC San Diego;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Clifford Ho, Sandia National Laboratories;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Abraham Shultz, U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special issue information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The aim of this special issue of Solar Energy is to consolidate in the state-of-the-art research in particle-based solar TES into a collection of review and technical articles that are authored by subject matter experts.

        "summary": "reimagining-the-sharing-economy-exploring-novel-organizational-structures-and-institutional-contexts-for-a-sustainable-future",
        "explain": "&lt;p&gt;The emergence of the sharing economy raised expectations that it would introduce novel organizational structures that provide a sustainable alternative to the existing methods of production and consumption. This was based on the idea that peer-to-peer sharing of underutilized assets, such as housing, vehicles, and food, would curb the overuse of scarce resources, foster individual entrepreneurship, and bolster social cohesion. Although the growth of the sharing economy platforms has been substantial, it remains uncertain if it has met the high aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;We invite scholars from various fields to revisit whether the principles and actions of the sharing economy offer a feasible solution to the major predicaments confronting humanity, such as the aggravating sustainability challenges, pandemics, and armed conflicts. These challenges expose the detrimental impact of prevailing practices at individual, organizational, institutional, and societal levels in our modern society, necessitating immediate resolution.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Contributions are welcomed addressing questions related to the sharing economy, including:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;• Do sharing economy examples meet the original hopes about sharing (e.g., social cohesion, cooperation, more ethical/sustainable alternatives)?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;• Which hopes about sharing economy still prevail and what are the new realistic expectations about its outlook?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;• What makes sharing economy organizations fail or hinders them from growing?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;• How has the sharing economy contributed to resilience and societal good in crises (e.g., response to pandemic, helping victims of armed conflicts)?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;• Will the new forms of organizing in the sharing economy complement or even substitute the prevailing models?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;We welcome contributions from several perspectives including such as:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;• sustainability and ecological economics&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;• organization, strategy, entrepreneurship, and innovation&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;• regulatory, legal, and government&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;• sociological and critical management&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;• psychology, marketing, and consumer behavior&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Christian Garaus&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;University of Natural Resources and Life Science, Vienna, Austria&lt;br&gt;Email: &lt;a href=\"mailto:christian.garaus@boku.ac.at\"&gt;christian.garaus@boku.ac.at&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Oksana Mont&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Lund University, Lund, Sweden&lt;br&gt;Email: &lt;a href=\"mailto:oksana.mont@iiiee.lu.se\"&gt;oksana.mont@iiiee.lu.se&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Yuliya Voytenko Palgan&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Lund University, Lund, Sweden&lt;br&gt;Email: &lt;a href=\"mailto:yuliya.voytenko_palgan@iiiee.lu.se\"&gt;yuliya.voytenko_palgan@iiiee.lu.se&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Angelika Schmidt&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Vienna University of Economics and Business, Vienna, Austria&lt;br&gt;Email: &lt;a href=\"mailto:angelika.schmidt@wu.ac.at\"&gt;angelika.schmidt@wu.ac.at&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manuscript submission information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;You are invited to submit your manuscript at any time before the submission deadline &lt;strong&gt;1 December 2023&lt;/strong&gt;. The journal’s submission platform (Editorial Manager&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;) will be available for receiving submissions to this Special Issue from &lt;strong&gt;1 September 2023&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Please refer to the Guide for Authors to prepare your manuscript, and select the article type of “&lt;strong&gt;VSI:Reimaging Sharing Economy&lt;/strong&gt;” when submitting your manuscript online.

The mitigation measures and actions, therefore, require holistic approaches and sound methods for implementable solutions. The current world situation is volatile due to various factors as the post-COVID recovery, fragile economies and conflicts. The 26th conference “Process Integration, Modelling and Optimisation for Energy Saving and Pollution Reduction” – PRES’23, held in Thessaloniki, Greece, 8-11 October 2023, provides a platform for discussing ideas and developing solutions for cleaner processes. Holistic approaches from the family of Process Integration employing systematic optimisation based on rigorous and simplified models enable increased process performance at the best possible efficiency of material and energy utilisation, enabling win-win solutions that minimise environmental impacts at improved economic performance.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manuscript submission information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;You are invited to submit your manuscript at any time before the submission deadline &lt;strong&gt;29 February 2024&lt;/strong&gt;. The journal’s submission platform (Editorial Manager&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;) will be available for receiving submissions to this Special Issue from 3&lt;strong&gt;1 October 2023&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Please refer to the Guide for Authors to prepare your manuscript, and select the article type of “&lt;strong&gt;VSI: PRES’23&lt;/strong&gt;” when submitting your manuscript online.

To address these challenges, the Pan-European Commission on Health and Sustainable Development (2021) has developed a new Call to Action on making healthcare greener in the post-pandemic era. The commissioners emphasize the need for coordinated efforts to attenuate biodiversity- and climate-related risks and call for innovative solutions to achieve sustainable healthcare. Similarly, the COP26 UN climate conference has also called for climate-resilient and low-carbon health systems to respond to mounting evidence that climate change is affecting global citizens’ health and wellbeing. To respond to these calls, the purpose of this special issue is to advance the knowledge of sustainable healthcare by encouraging research to look for innovative solutions that help achieve net-zero goals in healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Modern healthcare is one of the major contributors to pollution that adversely affects human health (Sherman et al., 2019). The global healthcare system has generated around 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions that are equivalent to the emission from 514 coal power plants (Healthcare Without Harm, 2019). Although the Paris Agreement encourages efforts to decarbonize healthcare, reducing carbon footprint through government policies and regulations, and technological innovations only indirectly affect the health sector (Bhopal &amp; Norheim, 2021). To address the growing concerns over the environmental sustainability of healthcare, researchers in the fields of cleaner production and sustainability have been putting tremendous effort into building a greener healthcare system from an individual (e.g., Xu et al., 2021), to organizational (e.g., Ryan-Fogarty et al., 2016), to industrial levels (e.g., Zimmer and McKinley, 2008).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Governmental authorities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have also established the decarbonization roadmaps in the healthcare sector. For example, in the UK, the national healthcare service (NHS) had committed to becoming “carbon net-zero” and already cut its own carbon footprint in 2020 by 62% compared to the international-standard 1990 baseline and by 26% when indirect factors are included. In particular, NHS addresses hospital food and catering waste, which accounts for 6% of the NHS's total greenhouse gases, by offering patients plant-based food options, implementing carbon labeling on food items, and switching to local food suppliers to reduce food miles. (NHS, 2020). Globally, with the Race-to-Zero campaign launched by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), more than 28,000 hospitals from 40 countries have committed to addressing health care climate challenges by 2021. This campaign targets net-zero carbon emissions by focusing on mitigation (reducing carbon footprints), resilience (preparing for extreme weather events and diseases), and leadership (providing education to promote climate change policies).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the pandemic is bringing some positive influence on climate action. The shortage of protective equipment in the healthcare system forced the hospitals and individuals to be ‘lean’ in managing their medical resources. For instance, online medical appointments are estimated to save 40,000 cars worth of carbon annually in the UK as they become more prevalent (Patel, 2021). Meanwhile, NHS Digital creates a more efficient data hosting environment, which results in a carbon reduction of 4,000 tonnes (Patel, 2021). Thus, a growing number of healthcare organizations are implementing low-carbon, digitally-enabled healthcare services in an effort to reduce travel to healthcare facilities. Future research can explore the ways in which digital technologies can be deployed to achieve sustainable and low carbon healthcare, as well as the conditions under which a net-zero healthcare transition is feasible and desirable.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Moreover, medical waste, regarded as the second most hazardous waste globally after radiation waste, has been increased greatly due to a large number of hospitalizations and medical testing during the pandemic (Saadat et al., 2020). The pandemic has caused a significant increase in disposable personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face masks, plastic gloves and insulation garments. According to recent reports, more than 129 million disposable masks and 65 billion gloves were used globally each month (Chen et al., 2021; Prata et al., 2020). This results in a dramatic explosion of medical waste generation all over the world. However, among healthcare professionals single-use plastic is viewed as a legitimate way to prevent infectious diseases, especially single-use protective equipment is viewed as the safter option (Ngo, 2020; Xu et al., 2021). Indeed, healthcare organizations are struggling to strike a balance between achieving patient safety and long-term sustainability. Therefore, it is imperative that we find innovative solutions to this dilemma to ensure a sustainable management of medical waste (Tirkolaee et al., 2021).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the growing body of literature on sustainable development in the healthcare fields, there is much to learn about processes and mechanisms to build a greener healthcare system and the technological, managerial, economic, and strategic impacts of net-zero policies on healthcare in the foreseen post-pandemic era. This requires engagement with questions that examine different stakeholders of the healthcare system (e.g., the policymakers, healthcare professionals, pharmaceutical companies, and patients). The guest editors of this special issue thus encourage scholars toward research on different promising paths to advance our understanding in building greener healthcare with the goals of net-zero carbon. We look for submissions from multiple disciplines including medicine, environmental management, sustainable marketing, engineering, operation management, information technology, psychology, and sociology.

Ferran’s research aims to uncover manufacturing and creative industries innovation, digitization, and internationalization dynamics. Across these themes, he has made a distinctive contribution through publications in top academic journals, including the Journal of International Business Studies, Journal of World Business, International Journal of Production Economics, Technovation, Industrial Marketing Management, and International Business Review, among others.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special issue information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;At the turn of the millennium, the concept of product-service systems (PSS) evolved from the idea of integrating products and services to meet customer needs (Goedkoop et al., 1999) to the recognition that, when compared to traditional offerings, PSS are sustainable solutions that create environmental, societal, and economic value (Mont, 2002; Roy, 2000; Tukker and Tischner, 2006; Vezzoli et al., 2015). Notably, the positive impact is evident when PSS are linked to dematerialized models (Dobers and Wolff, 1999) based on selling functionality (Alonso-Rasgado et al., 2004). Thus, the notion of sustainable PSS (SPSS) (Roy, 2000) echoed a move in sustainability-related research. Academics have embraced a multidisciplinary lens to stress the importance of SPSS design-related processes and practices (Vezzoli et al., 2015), SPSS assessment (Chou et al., 2015), and SPSS implementation and business model innovation (Reim et al., 2017). Moreover, the idea of PSS turned into a suitable approach for rethinking the role of services (Manzini et al., 2001) as a means towards cleaner industrialization (Annarelli et al., 2016; Ceschin, 2013; Sousa and Cauchick Miguel, 2015).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The servitization literature has used alternative labels when referring to PSS, such as integrated solutions, advanced services, and performance- or outcome-based contracts (Rabetino et al., 2018). Although it was somehow rooted in the PSS literature and has acknowledged some relevant aspects such as the concept of life-cycle services (Rabetino et al., 2015) and alternative routes to sustainable offerings in many sectors (Naor et al., 2018; Pelli and Lähtinen, 2020), the focus on the sustainable dimension of PSS had decreased when servitization scholars borrowed the concept from technical disciplines. Accordingly, whereas Rabetino et al. (2021) found that understanding capabilities for after-sale life-cycle services was a ‘cooling topic’, Haase et al. (2017) found that many of the 52 definitions of PSS they analyzed do not refer to the environmental impact of PSS and the presence of these references have decreased over time, which represents a refocus from ecological to economic benefits (Kjaer et al., 2019).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the time seems to have come when the servitization community could (and should) discuss the link between servitization and sustainability (Abdelkafi et al., 2022) to understand how servitization research can address and respond to the trends afflicting the planet and look for broader societal impact. Indeed, there are multiple opportunities to extend servitization research in this direction (Reim et al., 2015). For instance, in the past recent years, the Circular Economy (CE) paradigm has gained consideration as an avenue to support sustainability, while the implementation of SPSS has been pointed out as a strategy to enhance businesses circularity (Bocken et al., 2017; da Costa Fernandes et al., 2020). Although PSS do not necessarily lead to higher circularity (Kjaer et al., 2019; Pieroni et al., 2019; Tukker, 2015; Zink and Geyer, 2017) because the implementation is often product-centric (Matschewsky, 2019) and driven by profitmaking (Kjaer et al., 2019), and there exist different rebound effects (da Costa Fernandes et al., 2020), Kühl et al., (2018) suggest that offering PSS based of selling functionality incentivize manufacturers to include CE elements in their operations and, consequently, the CE framework may be an approach to analyze and overcome the impediments companies face when implementing SPSS (Hernandez, 2019) and servitization related circularity (Spring and Araujo, 2017).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Service innovation and quality (Balouei Jamkhaneh et al., 2022; Hussein Ali et al., 2022) and servitization may offer a solid basis for decarbonization towards net-zero emissions by combining business and technical approaches. Notwithstanding some remarkable exceptions (Bressanelli et al., 2018a, 2018b; Coreynen et al., 2021; Marić and Opazo-Basáez, 2019; Opazo-Basáez et al., 2018), the full benefits of sustainability- and circularity-oriented servitization are not entirely studied. Moreover, although there has been a proliferation of publications on the link between PSS and CE over the past five years (da Costa Fernandes et al., 2020; Kjaer et al., 2019; Kühl et al., 2019), there is no commonly agreed meaning of a ‘circular product-service system’ or a complete understanding of how the use of PSS contributes to circularity (Blomsma et al., 2018; da Costa Fernandes et al., 2020; Matschewsky, 2019). Undoubtedly, these opportunities are more significant and their exploration more exciting when we consider the convergence between the twin transitions of servitization and digitalization (Bressanelli et al., 2018a, 2018b), resulting in the trend known as digital servitization (Kohtamäki et al., 2019).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Indeed, we do not talk about a twin transition, but rather we speak of a triplet transition, including digitization, servitization, and the sustainable transition; being the focus on understanding and advancing support practices and business models when transforming business operations while considering the triplet transition’s three dimensions and the interplay at the ecosystem level (Yin et al., 2020). In other words, digital servitization allows companies to deliver product-service-software systems that are still typically driven by profitability and cost-effectiveness but do not fully consider sustainability-and circularity-related aspects.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic areas of interest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Against the above backdrop, this Special Issue call invites multidisciplinary conceptual and empirical contributions concerning (digital) servitization in supporting sustainability, circularity, green/sustainable supply chain, and resource wisdom in manufacturing. The SI aims to discuss the interplay between institutional influences, ecosystem dynamics, and strategic and innovation practices. We are particularly interested in business model innovation towards sustainable digital servitization and studies on achieving sustainability and circularity through PSS and sustainable life-cycle service offerings. Thus, we want to encourage scholars to submit research contributions based on established knowledge in servitization and PSS. We seek submissions from various perspectives with original and advanced thinking on sustainable and circular servitization. The overarching question is, how does embedding sustainability into business models through (digital) servitization strategies call for new organizational and ecosystem-wide practices that enable value creation and capture in manufacturing? We welcome academically-oriented papers with solid conceptual grounding that should look for, but not be limited to, answers to the following preliminary questions:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;How does digitization enable sustainability-oriented business model innovation, novel value creation, and capture practices in servitizing companies?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;How can digital servitization contribute to sustainability and sustainable value chain management?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;How could revenue streams from digitally-enabled services support sustainable practices in SME companies and their customers?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;How does digitization influence servitization strategies? And how do the resulting servitized business models support sustainable practices?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;A multistage review process will ensure that the special issue obtains the best mix of theory-driven, methodologically, and empirically-based articles.

Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Digitalization and information technologies are shaping novel societies, bringing different technological developments in field of engineering (Nižetić et al., 2020), ensuring various potential benefits for society in the future terms. On the other side, each technological development has got its price and where sustainability aspect becomes critical. The use of limited raw materials needs to be considered as well as also unknown impacts of information technologies on the environment, (Zhang et al., 2022). Energy field become dynamic and mainly driven by ongoing energy transition (Arora et al., 2022) that requires increase in renewable energy capacities (Saba et al., 2022), followed by energy efficiency (Adly et al., 2022), and finally more advanced energy storage solutions (Zarate-Perez et al., 2022). The impact of digitalization in the energy field is complex ones since focus can be directed on various aspects. For instance, digitalization in the energy generation systems ensures higher overall efficiency of the generation systems followed by better flexibility in various operating circumstances. Moreover, transmission and grid systems can also have benefits by involvement of smart information technologies that would ensure more advanced energy interconnectivity, communication and energy balancing between different energy systems. The final energy users, i.e. energy dissipations systems can be also better controlled and operated by involvement of information technologies. From, previous aspect, digitalization can also secure efficient communication, integration and finally balancing between production, transmission and consumption side.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The role of digitalization is rapidly progressing in several major fields that are important to the population such as; circular economy (Fan et al., 2020), waste management and elimination (Goutam Mukherjee et al., 2021), renewable energy concepts (Boddapati et al., 2022), energy storage technologies (Gupta et al., 2022), e-health (Rayan et al., 2022), followed by other areas where digitalization is bringing advancements. No matter that benefits of digitalization are already visible through interesting technological solutions, the key and important aspect must be directed to analysis and tracking of different environmental footprints, in order to minimize their impact. Therefore, the environmental protection is area of interest where digitalization can also help to reduce and to minimize harmful impacts of smart technologies on environment, especially in cities or high dense populated areas, (Balova et al., 2021).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Various engineering disciplines are called upon to provide their input, ensure the diffusion of fundamental and applied knowledge. The final goal is to secure knowledge towards firm actions that would help to solve the present and upcoming challenges of the population.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The virtual Special Volume (VSI) will include invited extended papers from &lt;strong&gt;SpliTech2022&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;7&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; International Conference on Smart and Sustainable Technologies&lt;/strong&gt;), that was held on hybrid way from July 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; to 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in Bol (Island of Brač) and Split, Croatia. The SpliTech conference is a multidisciplinary conference covering a range of topics, but with a focus on smart and sustainable technologies towards a smart and low-carbon development. The participants at the &lt;strong&gt;SpliTech2022&lt;/strong&gt; are highly encouraged to submit papers to this Special Volume for possible publication in JCLP. Authors who have not attended the conference but have suitable papers in hands are also welcome to submit a paper for this virtual Special Volume.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This SV is open to all engineering disciplines and a wide range of research topics addressing smart and sustainable technologies in general with focus on the digitalization in field of energy and sustainability, i.e. cleaner aspect should be demonstrated and discussed. The main emphasis would be directed to the core digitalization benefits and on the other side, how to reduce potential harmful impacts to the environment as unavoidable side effect of ongoing digitalization. Review papers are also accepted with the main focus being on advancements in digitalization with a strong link to practical applications in all sectors, however with emphasis on Energy sector as key one.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The Journal of Cleaner Production is a well-known and important platform for sharing multidisciplinary knowledge, innovations directed to cleaner production and sustainable development. Therefore, this VSI encourages submission of cross-disciplinary research work addressing major contemporary issues and exploring solutions to build a sustainable future.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Topical areas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This “Call for Papers” (CfPs) for the VSI of the Journal of Cleaner Production (JCLP) provides opportunities for scholars, industrial researchers, business and governmental officers to collaborate and accelerate the transition towards a smart and sustainable society. Papers should include comprehensive, up-to-date literature reviews, combined with novel theoretical and experimental investigations.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Potential topics for this VSI include, but will not be limited to, the following key topical areas:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(1) Digitalization in energy systems, processes and technologies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(2) Digitalization in circular economy and waste management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(3) Digitalization in environmental protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(4) Digitalization in smart city concept&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The energy systems are shifting to towards renewable energy sources with gradual reduction of the fossil based generation technologies as part of the ongoing energy transition. The role of digitalization in energy generation systems is to improve their operation, economic suitability and as well as to minimize an impact of the specific generation technologies to the environment. The more efficient control, demand side management and flexibility to the stochastic operating conditions would lead to the energy efficiency improvement of the generation systems. Demonstration and application of the novel smart solutions in the energy generation systems is necessary with respect to the energy transition.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The circular economy aspect is critical one since there are ongoing global and demanding problems regarding the waste issue. Significant waste generation (plastic waste, electronic waste, food waste, etc.) is creating severe issues to the environment, while on the other side in some economic branches there would be lack of raw resources in the close future. There is obvious need for further development of existing circular economy concepts and to maximize use of waste as the useful raw source for further processing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The environmental protection approaches can be also upgraded by implementation of digitalization technologies. The main goal is to develop smart and advanced monitoring and alerting systems in order to prevent harmful potential conditions in specific areas.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Smart city concept is very dynamic and promising research field as it demonstrates possible and effective integration of digitalization, with respect to the typical infrastructure demands, i.e. requests in the nowadays dense and populated cities or urban areas. The improvements of the cities infrastructure, security and life quality are significant ones and that can be achieved by proper application of the smart products and technologies. The benefits of the digitalization within the smart city concept are significant ones, however, the more intense research activity is needed in this area in order to better understand the limits and general capabilities of digitalization.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manuscript submission information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Contributors with proposals for papers are encouraged to communicate with the Co-editors by e-mail.

        "summary": "consumer-role-in-product-end-of-life-return-challenges-and-opportunities-for-circular-supply-chains",
        "explain": "&lt;p&gt;In the fast-changing current global business environment, sustainability and circularity in supply chains have become a recognized field of investigation across multiple operations research disciplines. Circular supply chains are critical for maximizing value creation throughout a product's life cycle (Mogale et al., 2022). Companies can spend less on raw materials with a circular supply chain, reducing the risk of price volatility (Nag et al., 2021). Therefore, many companies opt to collect their end-of-life (EOL) products to disassemble and return them to their raw material form to deal with growing raw material costs and volatile availability. Additionally, with the rise of shorter product lifecycles, supply chains must address greater amounts of obsolete and EOL products. However, the success of closing the loop in supply chains is largely dependent on the participation of consumers (Najmi et al., 2022). As a result, the parties' roles are reversed in this case, with the customer acting as the product's supplier (Bouzon et al., 2018; Mina et al., 2021).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Consumers, as suppliers in reverse supply chain contexts, are often unaware of the environmental harm that solid waste poses (i.e., e-waste). Consumers must make items available to manufacturers so that they have a proper final destination, while manufacturers must provide consumers with many options to encourage them to return the products (Kerber et al., 2021). Thus, the willingness of consumers to return their used products is critical to reverse supply chain success. A few people embrace the proactive approach and perform social responsibility by returning unwanted goods to collection centers. In this sense, consumers should be rewarded for returning their used goods (Mogali et al., 2022).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Even considering the crucial role of consumers in closing the supply chain, the literature on circular supply chains is primarily focused on B2B situations. Exploring the consumer side of the product, the starting point of the product in such a situation, is still very limited (Najmi et al., 2022). Moreover, the majority of previous research has focused solely on recycling, with few studies discussing other options for EOL products such as returning and disposing or donating and reselling. Previous research has ignored uncertain markets, conditions of returned products, and incentives (Mogali et al., 2022). Moreover, besides EOL returns, it is crucial to consider the rise of e-commerce and omnichannel in the past years, areas that particularly increased by the COVID-19 pandemic. E-commerce is undoubtedly the most visible and well-known force shaping today's supply chains (Jena &amp; Meena, 2022). With this growth, the number of products returned by consumers to retailers has achieved the mark of US $428 billion in 2020 (National Retail Federation, 2021).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, consumers have a special part in the operationalization of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) (Koshta et al., 2022; Islam et al., 2021). The discovery of factors that influence consumer return behavior is required to increase customer engagement, especially in e-waste collecting schemes. In this sense, technologies from Industry 4.0 may assist companies to better design and operate reverse networks to enhance product return. Through simulation tools and automated manufacturing lines, technologies from Industry 4.0 may assist current circular economy (CE) initiatives. The use of tools like digital platforms, blockchain, data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) can support decision-making along product end-of-life. In this context, machine learning and AI are notably crucial to fostering the integration of people, processes, and systems in a wide range of operational situations along circular supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, there is a gap with regard to the trending shift towards exploring the consumer side of the EOL product return. Managing a successful circular supply chain will require initiatives that also consider user experience, customer centricity, and customer loyalty, in addition to investigations on barriers and drivers for closing the loop from the consumer perspective. With these concerns in mind, the guiding research question of this call for papers is: “What are the challenges and opportunities to better involve, motivate, and engage the consumer in closing the loop of supply chain towards circular systems?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The objective of this CFP is to unveil practices, initiatives, tools, structures, and aspects related to closing the supply chain loop by considering consumer centricity as a supplier in the reverse cycle. This new picture reinforces the need to uncover these aspects regarding product return behavior to achieve sustainable goals.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Considering this proposed topic of this Call for Papers, the guest editors of the SI of the JCLP and CLSCN entitled “&lt;em&gt;Consumer role in product end-of-life return: challenges and opportunities for circular supply chains&lt;/em&gt;” welcome analytical, empirical, conceptual, quantitative, and qualitative research studies.

        "explain": "&lt;p&gt;There are urgent needs to make supply chains more resilient to support societal transitions to equitable, sustainable, post-fossil carbon societies, which are based upon circular economies. Authors are invited to address issues related to supply chains that increasingly integrate climate-change related risks that are driven by the annual 81 million increase in the human population that continue to increase food insecurity and the probability of more severe and frequent storms as well as increase the probability of COVID-19-like pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;All of these interconnected dimensions make it increasingly important that improvements in forward and reverse supply chains, are made so they are less vulnerable to disruptions locally, regionally, nationally and globally.

        "explain": "&lt;p&gt;Low-carbon mobility is at the heart of a new, sustainable transition of smart cities (Kley et al., 2011; Secinaro et al., 2021). Worldwide, many policy bodies are incentivizing manufacturers, vendors, and customers towards low-carbon forms of transportation (European Commission, 2021; OECD, 2014). Because of their varied, and often compact layout, researchers have identified opportunities for manufacturers of electric (EV) and hydrogen (FCEV) vehicles to create a multi-modal design paired with electric and traditional bicycles (Bigerna et al., 2016; Laurischkat et al., 2016; Graziano et all, 2020; Kazemzadeh &amp; Bansal, 2021; Gallaher et al., 2021).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;However, for industrial groups &amp; business choices to promote sustainable mobility actions it is crucial to discover how their business model can evolve to withstand such a fast-paced change.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;For example, automotive and e-bike producers have to make strategic choices that go beyond the vehicles, and include charging technologies, driver services, eletricity management, and commercial contracts, along with new production and assembly processes (Zuev, 2019; Secinaro et al., 2020, 2022; Papacharalampopoulos et al., 2020; Graziano, 2021).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, to political institutions whether a low carbon transition will be driven by electric mobility is relatively indifferent (Lieven, 2015). Institutions like the European Union (EU) or the US have made commitments on overall targets, rather than on specific paths of transition. For example, in the EU, countries have pledged to reduce greenhouse has emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;In this context, the change of business models towards the production of electric vehicles is just around the corner and at the top of their strategic plans for the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://api.journals.elsevier.com/media/1gddkzbp/marcello-graziano.png\" alt=\"\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Marcello Graziano&lt;br&gt;Organization: Southern Connecticut State University, Department of Management and International Business, USA&lt;br&gt;Email: grazianom5@southernct.edu&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://api.journals.elsevier.com/media/2iqd2ahd/paolo-biancone.png\" alt=\"\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Prof. Paolo Biancone&lt;br&gt;Organization: University of Turin, Department of Management, Italy&lt;br&gt;Email: paolo.biancone@unito.it&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special issue information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This special issue aims at hosting theoretical and empirical works focusing on the changes in the mobility sector driven by a transition towards a low carbon future.

The mitigation measures and actions therefore require holistic approaches and sound methods for implementable solutions. In an extremely volatile world recovering from a shock of unprecedented proportions such as the COVID pandemic supply of resources and energy, recycle and reuse of material and energy streams, and the delivery of produced goods add to an increasingly vulnerable production system and societal integrity. Holistic approaches in the form of process integration employing rigorous and accurate in predictions models and systematic optimisation procedures enable increased process performance at the best possible efficiency level in material and energy utilisation ensuring the satisfaction of environmental and societal sustainability goals.

He now is Senior Researcher at CML, the Institute for Environmental Sciences. Since the Eighties of last century, he was actively involved in the development of Life Cycle Analysis (LCA), Material Flow Analysis (MFA) and somewhat later Environmentally Extended Input-Output Analysis (EEIOA). Linking micro-level LCA to macro-level EEIOA, as a hybrid analysis, is one more off-shoot. In 2011 he received the biannual Society Prize of ISIE, the International Society for Industrial Ecology, for his life time contributions.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His PhD study was titled Macro-environmental policy: Principles and Design. Since his retirement his work shifted back to political science: how to link industrial ecology analysis to policy, both reckoning with public policies in IE-analysis and supporting policy design. Fossil energy flows are the main non-circular flows in society now, by mass and by value. His last book is Strategic Designs for Climate Policy Instrumentation: Governance at the Crossroads (Routledge 2019). His current research interest is how the approach as developed for climate policy instrumentation can be expanded, to more broadly cover the material functioning of society.&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;"

After received Ph.D degree from Hohai University in 1988, she has been dedicated to river water pollution control and treatment for 30 years, especially in the rehabilitation of seriously polluted urban rivers. In 2019, she was elected as academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering.&lt;br&gt;Prof. Xu took the lead in systematically studying the technical problems for black and odorous water treatment. Following the philosophy of imitating nature, she presented the technical system of synchronizing urban drainage overflow control with river water pollution control, harmonizing water system flowing with hydraulic structurers control, and coupling water quality improvement with water ecological restoration. She put forward the technical schemes of intercepting water pollution sources in conformity with river network flowing, eliminating river&rsquo;s dry-weather blackness and stench by tidal water energy and controlling river&rsquo;s wet-weather blackness and stench through abating sewer overflow pollution, which was proved to be very efficient for water quality amelioration of seriously polluted rivers. As&lt;br&gt;the chief scientist for Shanghai&rsquo;s Suzhou Creek rehabilitation, she made great contribution to getting rid of Suzhou Creek&rsquo;s blackness and foul stench that had been existed for over 70 years in the history of Shanghai. Suzhou Creek rehabilitation was awarded the Global Energy Prize in 2004 (first prize in the water resources group), which has become the typical case to demonstrate water quality restoration of seriously polluted urban rivers worldwide. As the first accomplisher, she was awarded for China&rsquo;s National Science and Technology Promotion Prize for two times (2003, 2014), and Shanghai Science and Technology Promotion Prize for seven times including 3 first-grade prizes and 4 second-grade prizes. She has published over 300 papers, 5 books, and has been issued over 30 patents. She was invited to compile special report on urban water pollution control by UN Habitat, which was released during the Fourth session of the UN Environment Assembly.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;"

In the near future, AI is expected to play an increasingly central role in the provision and education services in K-12 as well as in Higher Education contexts. New tools and services driven by AI and machine learning techniques are being deployed in chatbots, intelligent tutoring systems, automated grading systems and other algorithmic facilitated decision systems in the education sector. This Special Issue takes aim at these questions with a focus on equity, responsibility, fairness, autonomy, accountability, and transparency in the development and deployment of AIED.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prof. Milrad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Department of Computer Science and Media Technology&lt;br&gt;Linnaeus University, Sweden&lt;br&gt;marcelo.milrad@lnu.se&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prof. Cerratto-Pargman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Department of Computer Science&lt;br&gt;Stockholm University, Sweden&lt;br&gt;tessy@dsv.su.se&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assoc.

In the near future, AI is expected to play an increasingly central role in the provision and education services in K-12 as well as in Higher Education contexts. New tools and services driven by AI and machine learning techniques are being deployed in chatbots, intelligent tutoring systems, automated grading systems and other algorithmic facilitated decision systems in the education sector. Such AIED technologies are expected to provide personalized guidance, support, and feedback to students and assist teachers and policymakers in decision-making in a wide range of formal educational contexts (Hwang et al., 2020).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emerging research suggests that the use of AI in educational contexts has the potential to support teaching &amp; learning as well as improve human performance. At the same time, the misuse of AI due to algorithm bias and a lack of governance could inhibit human rights and result in solidifying existing inequalities (Prinsloo, 2020; Yang et al., 2021).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Responsible AI relates to human responsibility for developing and deploying AIED systems that align with fundamental human principles and values to safeguard human flourishing and well-being (Dignum, 2019). Responsibility can relate to the design of systems, their deployment, and how end-users understand and adopt them. Holmes et al. (2021), for instance, identify that AIED ethics consists of three interrelated dimensions; a) ethics of data, referring to ethical concerns related to data management, b) ethics of algorithms and computational approaches in education pertaining to choices for decision-making models’ development and c) ethics of education and pedagogy addressing the implications applications of AIED may have on professional practice, but also about end-users literacy when engaging with AIED. Such multiplicity and complexity of AIED development and deployment prompt central questions about equity, responsibility, fairness, autonomy, accountability, and transparency from a more integrative view of ethical issues and moral dilemmas and ethics in practice (Prinsloo, 2020; Slade and Prinsloo, 2013, Ceratto-Pargman &amp; McGrath, 2021; Velander et al., 2021).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The specific focus of this special issue is concerned with a range of questions as enumerated below:&lt;br&gt;• How are AIED tools, systems, and artefacts designed, developed, and deployed to align with human and educational values?&lt;br&gt;• What constitutes an equitable use of AIED systems?&lt;br&gt;• How are different ethical standpoints or guidelines considered in the design, development, and deployment of AIED, and what conflicts arise as a result, if any?&lt;br&gt;• When developing models to predict outputs and personalize learning across cohorts, how are ethics considered?&lt;br&gt;• How can AIED decisions be presented transparently and in an explainable manner enabling end-users to trust AIED systems?&lt;br&gt;• How do AIED design practices address the risks of bias?&lt;br&gt;• How are students and teachers’ AI literacy considered in designing, developing, and deploying AIED?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research areas / Topics to be addressed:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We welcome original contributions addressing conceptual aspects as well as empirical research on responsible AI issues in education. Papers submitted to this special issue should address and focus on equity, fairness, accountability, or transparency in relation to and in the context of education and associated practices. These contributions should be grounded in substantive ethical reasoning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contributions could include empirical studies focusing on the design of ethically sensitive AIED, where systems are conceptualized, designed, and trained to act ethically. We also welcome case studies related to the implementation of AIED tools and systems where practices have been potentially disrupted, with a focus on end-user perspectives&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another type of scientific contribution could address empirical studies focusing on stakeholder perspectives (e.g., developers, students, faculty, management, policymakers, etc.) views on equity and responsibility. Additional possible directions may include aspects related to policy and framework analysis relating to Responsible AI, both with an in-depth as well as a comparative dimension.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manuscript submission information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;If you are interested, please send a brief expression of interest including a tentative title, author list, and abstract to Dr. Marcelo Milrad at marcelo.milrad@lnu.se.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The journal's submission platform (Editorial Manager®) will be available for the invited authors for submitting submissions to this Special Issue.

        "explain": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overview of Special Issue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;During the last decades, Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have played a key role in democratic political and governance processes (Ramadani et al. 2022), seeking to engage citizens in participatory dynamics, supporting more democratic decision-making processes and strengthening representative democracy. By contrast, up to now, this implementation of ICTs has mainly produced higher data collection, better information flows and higher information transparency (Al Sulaimani and Ozuem, 2022).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;With the rise of emerging technologies (ETs), new sceneries seem to be arisen. Indeed, ETs should go beyond providing higher access for citizens to participate in public issues, co-creating and co-deciding public affairs in an equal power basis with public institutions (Casiano et al., 2022; Mergel, 2015), especially in crisis situations (Criado et al., 2020). It also offers the opportunity to monitor the behavior of public managers and politicians, which improves accountability and promotes democratic processes by opening critical issues for different communities (Schmidthuber et al., 2017). This way, an increasing number of governments around the world are implementing platforms, applications, and tools based on ETs to promote an informed citizenry, direct voting, and crowdsourced decisions, trying to increase trust in government (Marino and Lo Presti, 2018).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, although academic scholars have highlighted the need to strengthen research focused on actual practices of citizen involvement in public issues (Rodríguez Bolívar et al. 2018; Alcaide Muñoz et al. 2017), we can only find prior research analyzing models and frameworks that have addressed this question (Cortés-Cediel et al. 2019; Boukris et al. 2016). Also, evidence of e-participation initiatives and projects in which ETs are being used is scarce, limiting the understanding and learning that these practical experiences could provide. Therefore, this special issue seeks to shed some light with contributions offering rigorous research evidence about these experiences to fill the gap in the use of ETs in e-participation initiatives, especially concerning the ET implementation and impact on citizen engagement in collaborative governance models.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indicative List of Anticipated Themes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This special issue seeks a wide range of papers that deal with diverse projects of ETs implementation in governance models, especially at the smart city level, to favor progress in this field of knowledge with the consequent impact and practical implications necessary to develop these ETs initiatives. All the papers submitted should also be sure that they fit with the scope of the journal Sustainable Cities and Society.

        "explain": "&lt;p&gt;A smart city refers to a city that, as a result of a basic infrastructure, can provide all its citizens with a good quality of life, inserted in the context of a sustainable environment through the use of smart technological solutions. The current challenges faced by a smart city are observed in different domains: from mobility to health, through energy, infrastructure, security, among many others. To fulfill the premise of improving the quality of life and smart outcomes for citizens, a “people-centric” paradigm becomes essential with strategic technology components to support it. Although there are countless efforts and contributions in this regard, it is clear that there is still a large space for research in this area. The proliferation of digital transformation and the exponential advance that has taken place in technological areas, associated with the pandemic that is still felt today, brought the need to explore the benefits of emerging areas and brought even greater importance to the collection, analysis, processing and sharing of data, its application to different domains and raised questions related to security and privacy. All this with the aim of building more resilient cities, flexible to change and with a focus on sustainable growth and for the benefit of the citizens. These advances will be made possible through technological research, supporting infrastructure and their application in real scenarios and complex systems.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. &lt;a href=\"https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=36447905300\"&gt;Sara Paiva&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Affiliation: Instituto Politécnico de Viana do Castelo, Viana do Castelo, Portugal&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. &lt;a href=\"https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=14056217000\"&gt;Shafi Khadem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Affiliation: Tyndall National Institute, Cork, Ireland&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. &lt;a href=\"https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57881894800\"&gt;Chun Sing Lai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Affiliation: Brunel University London, Uxbridge, United Kingdom&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. &lt;a href=\"https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57212166634\"&gt;Antonios Papaemmanouil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Affiliation: Hochschule Luzern, Luzern, Switzerland&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. &lt;a href=\"https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56652204500\"&gt;Tarek Alskaif&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Affiliation: Wageningen University &amp; Research, Wageningen, Netherlands&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manuscript submission information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Schedule:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Paper submission due: January 15, 2022&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;First-round acceptance notification: March 5, 2023&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Revision submission: April 5, 2023&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Notification of final decision: June 15, 2023&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Submission of Camera-Ready final paper: June 30, 2023&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Publication date: July 30, 2023&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Submission Site: &lt;a href=\"https://www.editorialmanager.com/scsi/default2.aspx\"&gt;Editorial Manager®&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Article Type Name: &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VSI:Trends on Smart Cities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;” &lt;/strong&gt;- please select this item when you submit manuscripts online.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;For any inquiries about the appropriateness of contribution topics, welcome to contact Managing Guest Editor &lt;a href=\"mailto:%20Sara.paiva@estg.ipvc.pt\"&gt;Dr. Sara Paiva&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Guide for Authors will be helpful for your future contributions, read more: &lt;a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/journals/sustainable-cities-and-society/2210-6707/guide-for-authors\"&gt;SCS - Guide for Authors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;For more information, please visit our ScienceDirect Page: &lt;a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/sustainable-cities-and-society\"&gt;Sustainable Cities and Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Learn more about the benefits of publishing in a special issue: &lt;a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/authors/submit-your-paper/special-issues\"&gt;https://www.elsevier.com/authors/submit-your-paper/special-issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Interested in becoming a guest editor?

        "explain": "&lt;p&gt;This Special Issue focuses on future cities and in particular, the people who live in them, the natural environment they must coexist with; and the technologies that will facilitate human activities without causing irreversible damage to the environment. &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;It is believed that understanding the people-environment-infrastructure relationships is the key to make future cities and society resilient and sustainable. Infrastructure includes basic facilities that are place-based and are serving public interests and supporting a great variety of economic activities. Many infrastructure systems also have a high capital-output ratio and a long lifespan. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop fundamentally new ways of planning and constructing infrastructure for future cities and conceiving the ways in which infrastructure will interact with people and the environment in future cities. &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This Special Issue welcomes innovative and interdisciplinary contributions that focus on the people-environment-infrastructure relationship in future cities. &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prof. Becky P.Y.

The way people interact in urban built environments also depends on urban systems and their networks that govern resource and service accessibility, inclusivity, and resilience. The interconnectedness of human-urban-buildings should be discovered considering forthcoming societal changes entailed to technological advancements and adoptions. Thus, the scientific understanding of human-urban-building interactions should be advanced and delineated.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, existing buildings and civil infrastructures shall be transformed by designing and presenting intelligent adaptation and intervention of smart and sustainable technologies to improve social, economic, and environmental well-being. In particular, the infrastructure utilizing disruptive technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR), social media networks, etc.) should be designed by combining existing archetypes with experiential, energy, environmental and physical performance, and services of networked urban systems. These techniques will result in multi-scale and multi-dimensional impacts on human well-being, building energy and comfort, environmental quality, societal benefits, and carbon emissions. However, with the lack of analyzing the impacts, transformative strategies and actions with intelligent technologies in smart cities are not verified yet. Therefore, the major goal of this special issue is to provide paradigm shifts in human-urban-building interactions with intelligent application of disruptive technologies in the future smart cities for sustainability, economic growth, health, and overall quality of life. &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Hence, topics may include but are not limited to the following:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Urban system of systems including human movements and behaviors;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Social, economic, and environmental well-being of the natural and built environments;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Disruptive technology for future smart cities;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Carbon neutral, Climate-resilient, and Human well-being urban systems;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Human-oriented urban built environments;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;AI-assisted smart and connected communities.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manuscript submission information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manuscript Submission Open Date: June 30, 2022&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manuscript Submission Deadline: March 01, 2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Submission Instructions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;You are invited to submit your manuscript at any time before the submission deadline.

        "summary": "smart-tools-and-technologies-for-integration",
        "explain": "&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\tEnergy storage systems (ESSs) are emerging as a solution to improve efficiency, sustainability, and reliability of energy systems. ESSs could foster the integration of renewable energy technologies, such as wind and solar, by accommodating their intermittent nature. In addition, energy storage can serve as a buffer both for energy carriers (such as grids and pipelines) and remote (off-grid) communities, to enhance their resiliency in case of extreme circumstances such as natural hazards or operational disruptions. In the light of the above emergence of ESSs, their integration to balance the demand and supply sides of energy systems still remains a challenge and a complex task, due to multiplicity of the involved decision variables, fluctuating nature of energy demand, uncertainties on the supply side, and variability of technologies, cost and scale. These complexities have given rise to the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and smart tools founded on the increasing use of data collection and analysis, as well as smart technologies based on recent advancements in hardware and software for digitization and visualization, in order to intelligently control and operate energy storage systems integrated at building, district, and community scales. The special issue welcomes technical papers, case studies, and state-of-the-art reviews on use of smart tools and technologies in design, integration, operation, and control of ESSs that include (but not limited to):&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\t- Data-driven algorithms for optimization of ESSs&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\t- Applications of artificial intelligence in operation and control of ESSs&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\t- Economics of intelligent energy storage&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\t- Real-time and model predictive controls for ESSs&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\t- Smart scheduling for ESSs&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\t- Networked/distributed ESSs and intelligent coordination&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\t- Smart design and automation for ESSs&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\t- Data-driven reliability and resiliency assessment of ESSs&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\t- Digitization and building information modeling for ESSs&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\t- IoT and cloud systems for ESSs monitoring and control&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\t&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\t&lt;strong&gt;Timeline and submission instructions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\tDeadline for Submissions: November 1, 2021&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\tDecisions Sent to Authors: June 30, 2022&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\tAt submission please select article type:&lt;strong&gt;&nbsp;Smart Energy Storage Systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\t&nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\t&lt;strong&gt;Guide for Authors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\tInstructions for article submission follow the guide in this link:&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\t&lt;a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/journals/sustainable-cities-and-society/2210-6707/guide-for-authors\"&gt;Guide for Authors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\t&lt;strong&gt;Guest Editors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\tDr. Fuzhan Nasiri, Concordia University,&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"mailto:fuzhan.nasiri@concordia.ca\"&gt;fuzhan.nasiri@concordia.ca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\tDr. Ryozo Ooka, University of Tokyo,&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"mailto:ooka@iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp\"&gt;ooka@iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\tDr. Ruchi Chaudhary, University of Cambridge,&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"mailto:rc488@cam.ac.uk\"&gt;rc488@cam.ac.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\tDr. Frederic Kuznik, INSA Lyon,&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"mailto:frederic.kuznik@insa-lyon.fr\"&gt;frederic.kuznik@insa-lyon.fr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\tDr. Alireza Afshari, Aalborg University,&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"mailto:aaf@build.aau.dk\"&gt;aaf@build.aau.dk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\tDr. Enrico Fabrizio, Politecnico di Torino,&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"mailto:enrico.fabrizio@polito.it\"&gt;enrico.fabrizio@polito.it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n\\tDr. Mariagrazia Dotoli, Politecnico di Bari,&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"mailto:mariagrazia.dotoli@poliba.it\"&gt;mariagrazia.dotoli@poliba.it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

        "biography": "Dr. Mohammad Sameti is currently a senior researcher in MaREI and an adjunct lecturer in mechanical engineering working on green hydrogen energy, a partnership between UCC, DCU and NUIG as well as 25 industry companies, with the aim of cost-effective decarbonisation through large-scale implementation of hydrogen technologies in Ireland and EU. \\n\\nCURRENT ACTIVITIES: Mohammad is involved in several projects namely HyLIGHT, Green Hysland, and International Energy Agency ANNEX 37. He is exploring the optimisation of green hydrogen supply chains in Ireland as well as developing and implementing a hydrogen ecosystem for Mallorca in collaboration with a wide range of industrial and academic partners in Ireland, the UK, Spain, and Netherlands. The model includes short-, medium-, and long-term supply chain scenarios for green hydrogen in Ireland and Mallorca, considering different electricity supplies (onshore/offshore wind, PV, grid), energy end-uses, supply chain sizes, and geographical locations. He also holds the position as an editor in Intelligent Buildings International published in Taylor and Francis. \\n\\nBACKGROUND: Mohammad received his PhD in mechanical engineering from Concordia University, Canada. His previous research was focused on optimization and modelling of district energy systems, integration of renewable energies, hybrid energy systems, thermodynamics cycles, and thermo-economic analysis. Those research areas were connected to IEA-ECES Annex 31 &ldquo;Energy storage with Net Zero Energy Buildings and Districts: Optimization and Automation&rdquo; and published as a part of it. Mohammad joined University College Dublin (UCD Energy Institute) under Energy Systems Integration Partnership Programme (ESIPP) as a postdoctoral researcher working on diversification of gas end-use and supply. In that project, Mohammad investigated the potential of an integrated energy system considering the need for gas-fuelled power stations. The proposed model explores future scenarios to complement wind and other renewable electricity sources in Ireland while at the same time covering seasonal peak domestic and industrial heating demands. He is also experienced with numerical and experimental control of lift-WEC wave energy convertors at Center for Ocean Energy Research (COER)."

Carbon storage and utilization in the subsurface is a key to tackle this challenge, especially fossil energy is still dominating the energy field. Carbon dioxide storage and utilization is likely to be widely deployed in the coming decades due to major climate and economic drivers, and hence hundreds of millions or billions of tons of Carbon dioxide may be stored annually. The Special Issue focuses on the recent advances in carbon storage and utilization.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assoc.

        "biography": "I graduated in Chemical Engineering 'cum laude' at the University of Genoa (Italy) in December 1992. In July 1997, I earned a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from the Polytechnical School of Turin (Italy). Afterward, I continued my research activity at the University of Genoa, and at the Department of Chemistry of Princeton University, NJ (USA), where, in 1999, I spent the whole year as a research associate. From 2001 to 2005, I was a researcher in the field, ING-IND/24, Principles of Chemical Engineering, at the University of Genoa. Since February 1, 2005, I have been an associate professor in the field ING-IND/25, Chemical Plants, at the same University, where I currently teach the courses 'Chemical Engineering Computing' and 'Separation Columns'.\\nMy research focuses on chemical and electrochemical reactors, with attention to the optimization of all those aspects which could improve efficiency and environmental compatibility. More in detail, my studies focus on fuel cells of various types, and steam methane reforming reactors. I have developed both experimental and theoretical activities, at all levels of detail, from the microscopic scale, up to the reactor and whole plant scale. \\nI have taken part in several research projects, sponsored by various Italian and international organizations (EU, MURST, CNR, DOE, British Council). I was responsible for a research contract between the University of Genoa and Rolls-Royce Fuel Cell Systems (UK), from 2002 to 2009, and during that period my Chair at the University of Genoa was financed by Rolls-Royce Fuel Cell Systems (UK). Recently (2019-2022), I was responsible for two projects sponsored by Regione Liguria. One was focused on the development of a FEM simulation tool for a steam methane reforming reactor operating at the refinery IPLOM (Busalla, GE, Italy). The second was focused on the development of membrane filtration plants.\\nI am the author of over 130 papers in international journals, conference proceedings, and chapters of edited books. Bibliometric indicators: H-index 27, total citations 5379 (Scopus, August 2022). \\n\\nTop Scientist\\nThe international journal PLOS Biology recently published a ranking of the best scientists in the world. Based on bibliometric parameters, the authors of the work evaluated all researchers who have at least 5 papers recorded by the Scopus database: about 6,900,000 scientists worldwide. This allowed the names of the first 100,000 scientists to be sorted and published, corresponding to 1.5% of those evaluated. I am on the list, at position 82602. For more details: J.P.A. Ioannidis et al. (2019), A standardized citation metrics author database annotated for scientific field. PLoS Biol, 17(8) e3000384. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000384.\\n\\nResearch Interests\\nMy research is focused on three main topics.\\nThe first topic is electrochemical reactors (fuel cells and electrolyzers), with attention to the optimization of all those aspects which could improve the energy efficiency and the environmental compatibility of the reactor and eventually of the whole plant. The studies have been concentrated on solid oxide and proton exchange membrane cells (SOCs and PEMCs respectively). I developed both experimental and theoretical activities, and all the levels of detail have been analyzed, from a microscopic scale (electrolyte and electrodes), up to the single cell and stack scale and then to the whole plant scale. \\nThe second topic is steam methane reforming (SMR) reactors, through an innovative multiscale modeling approach, addressing the catalyst, tube, and furnace levels simultaneously. \\nThe third topic is water treatment and reverse osmosis. \\n\\nEditorial Activity\\nI have been serving as a reviewer for several international journals, including the Journal of Applied Electrochemistry, Journal of Power Sources, Journal of Fluids Engineering, Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power, Electrochimica Acta, Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research, Journal of Membrane Science, Chemical Engineering Science, Journal of the Electrochemical Society. I have been recognized as Outstanding Reviewer by the Elsevier Journals: Journal of Cleaner Production, Journal of Power Sources, Electrochimica Acta, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. \\nSince 2003, I have been a member of the Editorial Board (International Advisory Board) of the Journal of Power Sources (Elsevier, IF2019: 8.247). Since 2017, I have been a member of the Editorial Board (Editorial Advisory Board) of Energy Conversion and Management (Elsevier, IF2019: 8.208). Since February 2020, I have been a member of the editorial board of &lsquo;Energies&rsquo;, section &lsquo;Hydrogen Energy&rsquo; (MDPI, IF2019:2.702).\\nI was Guest Editor of a Special Issue of Energies (MDPI) titled &lsquo;Reacting Transport Phenomena in Electrochemical Cells&rsquo;, 2015/2016. Furthermore, I was Guest Editor of a Special Issue of Catalysts (MDPI) titled &lsquo;Solid Oxide Fuel Cells &ndash; The Low Temperature Challenge&rsquo;, 2018/19.\\nI was a member of the scientific committee of several international conferences (EU SOFC &amp; SOE Forum, Luzern, CH, editions 2016, 2018, 2020 and 2022).\\n\\nThesis Direction\\nSince 2003, I have supervised 22 BSc Theses, 28 MSc Theses, and 7 Ph.D. Theses at the University of Genoa, Italy."

        "explain": "&lt;p&gt;Digital disruption has affected many areas of the world and society (Nyagadza, 2022). The influence of digital industry and the digitalization of enterprises on business innovation has become a major research topic (Li et al., 2023). Interest in information and communication technology (ICT) and its application in emerging economies has increased in recent years (Tongkaw, 2013). Technological innovation has had benefits that vary across geographies and social classes (Phillips &amp; Linstone, 2016). Thus, it is essential to consider the socioeconomic implications of digitalization in emerging countries.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;table border=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\"&gt;\\n&lt;tbody&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td style=\"width: 16.7949%;\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://api.journals.elsevier.com/media/jzzj3fgs/prof-bing-xu.jpg?width=113&amp;height=154&amp;mode=max\" alt=\"Prof Bing Xu\" width=\"113\" height=\"154\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td style=\"width: 83.2051%;\"&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prof Bing Xu&lt;/strong&gt;, Zhejiang Gongshang University (in Service Zhejiang Association of Quantitative Economics, China)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORCID:&lt;/strong&gt; 0000-0002-6545-1385&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Area(s) of Expertise: &lt;/strong&gt;digital intelligence, technological innovation discovery, risk identification and control, non-parametric path identification methods and applications&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td style=\"width: 16.7949%;\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://api.journals.elsevier.com/media/tcinlshj/prof-juying-zeng.jpg?width=110&amp;height=150&amp;mode=max\" alt=\"Prof Juying Zeng\" width=\"110\" height=\"150\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td style=\"width: 83.2051%;\"&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prof Juying Zeng&lt;/strong&gt;, Hangzhou City University&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORCID:&lt;/strong&gt; 0000-0002-7166-7270&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Area(s) of Expertise:&lt;/strong&gt; Digital governance; policy effect of digital policy; causal inference; business strategy evaluation and optimization&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td style=\"width: 16.7949%;\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://api.journals.elsevier.com/media/0whpcpwd/domingo.jpg\" alt=\"Domingo\" width=\"110\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td style=\"width: 83.2051%;\"&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prof Domingo Ribeiro-Soriano&lt;/strong&gt;, University of Alcala (in Service Commission by the University of Valencia)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORCID:&lt;/strong&gt; 0000-0003-3222-9101&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Area(s) of Expertise:&lt;/strong&gt; Entrepreneurship; digital business; business strategy; social entrepreneurship&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\\n&lt;/table&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special issue information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Emerging markets are currently undergoing economic, social, political and demographic transitions. They can leverage digital technologies to drive business innovation (Dana et al., 2022). There is growth in the development of innovative ideas and products by local companies in emerging countries (Zeschky et al., 2011). Thus, the role of business groups is fundamental in emerging economies (Khanna &amp; Rivkin, 2001). The strategies of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have been influenced by the challenges posed by digital technologies (Ferreira et al., 2022). Because of the varying characteristics of emerging economies, analysis of the adoption of ICTs at the micro, meso and macro levels is essential (Tortorella et al., 2021). There are differences not only between advanced and emerging countries but also between different emerging markets (Claessens &amp; Yurtoglu, 2013). The institutional perspective is useful for companies in emerging economies to improve their competitiveness, especially when growing internationally (Peng et al., 2008).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Authors such as Tamvada et al. (2022) have called for the validation and prioritization of research into the risks of SMEs’ implementation of Industry 4.0 in emerging economies, highlighting the lack of literature. Thus, expanding the lines of research in this field and extending the scientific study of the impact of digitalization in emerging countries is important. A formal call is made to the academic research community to contribute to these research lines. Scholars are invited to consider the questions raised and to consider others that they deem relevant within this thematic framework. Such collaboration will be valuable for advancing knowledge in this field and for benefiting society as a whole. Other issues that could also be considered in this Special Issue include the following:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;How does the implementation of digital technologies in developing economies facilitate the spread of innovative practices in the corporate world?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;What are the present economic and social consequences of digitalization in developing economies?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;What are the challenges and opportunities associated with the deployment of digital technologies in emerging markets?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;How do digital technologies affect the innovation potential of firms?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;How can companies take advantage of the new opportunities offered by digital technologies to innovate and thrive in emerging countries?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special Issue workshop:&lt;/strong&gt; There are plans to run a paper development workshop for this Special Issue during the IMIP Conference in Hangzhou (China) between 13 Oct and 15 Oct 2023. Participants of the workshop are encouraged to submit their full papers via the conference submission system. The Special Issue Guest Editors will then invite authors of a selection of papers to this workshop to discuss their papers.

One of the goals of the Conference is to select papers that, depending on the scope of the participating journals and the quality of the papers, will appear in Special Issues or Special Sections of these participating journals. The selection and review of articles will be carried out initially by the Conference Advisory Committee. Papers whose theoretical framework and method do not meet the standards of quality and rigor required by the participating journals will not be accepted for presentation at the Conference. Papers that pass the first review stage will then be reviewed by the Academy Editorial Advisory Board, and decisions will be taken by the Guest Editors of the associated journals. Papers should be highly relevant and should closely fit the participating journals’ scope and research focus. After the Conference, the Guest Editors of each journal will decide which papers will be recommended for inclusion in the Special Issues of the corresponding publications. Depending on the quality of submissions, best papers will be published in the Special Issues of these SSCI journals. The Conference is unique in this respect. The deadline for submitting papers is February 1, 2024 (for full papers). Papers should be submitted to the Conference via the Conference website (https://www.aciek-academy.com).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;table border=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\"&gt;\\n&lt;tbody&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td style=\"width: 18.9744%;\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://api.journals.elsevier.com/media/qnmdjc0e/crisitina.jpg\" alt=\"crisitina\" width=\"110\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td style=\"width: 81.0256%;\"&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prof. Cristina Blanco-González-Tejero, &lt;/strong&gt;University of Alcalá, Madrid, Spain&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORCID&lt;/strong&gt;: 0000-0003-1003-0847&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Areas of Expertise: &lt;/strong&gt;Entrepreneurship; Soft Skills; Digital Technologies; Social Networks; Digital Business&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td style=\"width: 18.9744%;\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://api.journals.elsevier.com/media/rjzhp4s5/klaus.jpg\" alt=\"klaus\" width=\"110\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td style=\"width: 81.0256%;\"&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prof. Klaus Ulrich,&lt;/strong&gt; ESIC Business and Marketing School, Madrid, Spain&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;ORCID: 0000-0003-1003-0847&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Areas of Expertise: &lt;/strong&gt;Crowdfunding; FinTech; Finance; Blockchain; Entrepreneurship; Business Strategy&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;td style=\"width: 18.9744%;\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://api.journals.elsevier.com/media/0whpcpwd/domingo.jpg\" alt=\"Domingo\" width=\"110\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;td style=\"width: 81.0256%;\"&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prof. Domingo Ribeiro-Soriano,&lt;/strong&gt; University of Alcala (in Service Commission from the University of Valencia)&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORCID&lt;/strong&gt;: 0000-0003-3222-9101&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Areas of Expertise: &lt;/strong&gt;Entrepreneurship; Digital Business; Business Strategy; Social Entrepreneurship; Business Sustainability&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/td&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;/tbody&gt;\\n&lt;/table&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manuscript submission information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Authors are invited to present their papers on “&lt;strong&gt;Innovative and meaningful knowledge: towards a sustainable world&lt;/strong&gt;” at the Conference, which will be held in Paris in June 2024.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Participation in the Conference itself or acceptance of a paper for presentation does not guarantee that the authors will be selected for the TFSC Special Issue.

Given the integration of AI and HI helps optimize time-intensive processes, abate decision biases as well as minimize systemic risks in sophisticated activities, many humanitarian organizations and governments have applied it to better forecast and evaluate the efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency of complex humanitarian aid operations that affect the life or death of people in need.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;However, given the hybrid application of AI and HI in the humanitarian sector is a nascent phenomenon, quite a few debates remain. For instance, some scholars advocate that AI cannot completely replace HI because the former lacks the flexibility and creativity that is so desperately needed in the humanitarian sector (Guss and Dorner, 2017). In contrast, some argue that AI with its unique machine learning attribute can synthesize the wisdom of a wider range of stakeholders than HI and thus should play a dominant role in humanitarian aid operations involving rich data from numerous stakeholders (George, 2017). Considering these controversies, there exist huge challenges and unanswered questions about whether and how the integration of AI-HI can be applied in humanitarian aid operations.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;According to the to the United Nations’ Global Humanitarian Review 2022, extreme poverty is rising, climate change is worsening, and millions of people are confronted with acute food insecurity. In 2023, a series of devastating earthquakes hitting Turkey and Syria have just drawn the world’s great attention. These incidents signal the growing need for humanitarian aids across borders. However, as discussed above, on the one hand, AI may be ideal for handling highly repetitive and precise tasks, but some complex tasks still need to be performed by HI, such as those intertwined with socio-psychological concerns, e.g., critical thinking, ethics, and cultural values. On the other hand, AI keeps evolving and may eventually become a counterpart of the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The challenges and paradoxes addressed above not only imply some barriers to the success but also plenty of new opportunities in integrating AI and HI to optimize cross-border relief operations. Without doubt, it is imperative to fill the research gap. In response, given the infancy of relevant research, we organize this Special Issue (SI) to enrich this novel field of research that associates AI-HI integration with social, environmental, technological, and humane progress in the humanitarian sector.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;We welcome and invite conceptual and empirical studies based on a multitude of methods that address the representative topics outlined below. We particularly welcome cross-country empirical studies and encourage novel and innovative methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;• How to engage stakeholders from a wide range of complex systems at macro, meso, and micro levels for AI-HI integration in humanitarian aid operations, ranging from financial, market, human resource, emergency/risk management, logistics systems to other associated systems?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;• How to deploy existing or develop new technologies and innovation processes to promote AI-HI integration in humanitarian aid operations?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;• How to create an ecosystem and business models involving multiple industries such as microchip manufacturing, service, transport, and the like for AI-HI integration in humanitarian aid operations?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;• How to manage and develop AI-driven applications for AI-HI integration in humanitarian aid operations?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;• What kind of AI-driven interconnection for seamless communication is needed for AI-HI integration in humanitarian aid operations?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;• How to promote AI-HI integration in humanitarian aid operations (e.g., enhancing information transparency, and knowledge sharing and transferring for decision-making etc)?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;• How to improve simulation and visualization of AI-HI integration in humanitarian aid operations?

Scope&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of this Special Issue is to provide stronger theoretical foundations to the field of technological forecasting. The overarching research question are:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;How can innovation theories explain empirical results from forecasting studies?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;How can the practice of forecasting improve by incorporating insights from existing innovation theories?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;In particular, this Special Issue focuses on empirical forecasting methods aimed at predicting &lt;strong&gt;technology adoption and diffusion&lt;/strong&gt;. These include technometrics and judgemental methods, among others, which may include structural and predictive variables in addition to time. This Special Issue does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; focus on naïve forecasting methods, or on forecasting methods targeted at financial forecasting.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Our ultimate goal is to increase rigor in the field of technological forecasting. The academic standards for reliability and validity of science are higher than ever. At the same time, we observe a large number of publications in the journal which propose new forecasting tools and methods with little theoretical background, and limited generalizability.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Necessity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Theory-oriented researchers usually have a different background, and publish in different journals, than practice-oriented researchers. If nothing is done, the gap between one and the other will continue widening. We see this Special Issue as an opportunity to reconcile both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Promotion&lt;/strong&gt;: this SI will attract quality submissions by holding a paper development workshop (see below), and by exploiting the network of the guest editors. We are also considering the option of hosting a session at one academic conference.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Management&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The first step of the review process will be to decide whether a submitted paper is relevant to the Special Issue, and meets the standards of academic research, or should be desk rejected. For this first step, submitted papers will be distributed evenly among the team of guest editors.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Once we have filtered the papers which are not relevant, the guest editors will gather to discuss the remaining papers. After the discussion, each paper will be assigned to one of the guest editors, always trying to match the topic of the paper and the expertise of the guest editor.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Given that the purpose of the SI is to bridge the gap between theory and practice, we think it is essential to have at least one referee who is an expert in the theory with which the authors substantiate their work, and one referee who is an expert in the forecasting method they use. To mitigate the risk of referees not accepting our invitation, or not delivering their reviews on time, we will initially send request to four referees (two on the theoretical side, and two on the empirical side).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The referees will ideally be drawn from the list of references of the paper, and the personal network of the guest editors. If this were not enough, or the selected referees were not responsive, we would use the journal’s database to find additional referees.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The guest editor will also review the paper and provide additional feedback to the authors not covered by the referees, if deemed necessary. This feedback might be important, for instance, to increase the consistency between papers in the SI.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Papers with mixed reviews will be discussed by the whole team of guest editors, before making the final decision.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Call for papers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This Special Issue focuses on empirical forecasting methods aimed at predicting technology adoption and diffusion. These include technometrics (Coccia, 2005) and judgemental methods, among others, which may include structural and predictive variables in addition to time. This Special Issue does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; focus on naïve forecasting methods, or on forecasting methods targeted at financial forecasting.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The field of technological forecasting was born in, and has always inherently been connected to, practice. Early forecasting practice during the Cold War was driven by government initiatives to develop comprehensive R&amp;D strategies for technological and military supremacy (Coates et al., 2001). These initiatives resulted in techniques such as TRIZ (Altshuller and Shapiro, 1956), Delphi (RAND, 1967), and basic trend and envelope analyses (Schon, 1967). During these early stages, knowledge exchange was difficult due to the small size of forecasting communities, and the sensitive nature of the topics tackled. As forecasting methods became more popular, large corporations became some of the most important locus of forecasting research, adapting existing methods and creating their own. For instance, companies such as Motorola, BP, or Philips were instrumental in developing technology roadmapping tools (Kerr and Phaal, 2020) which now are widely used by companies, governments, and research institutions internationally.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the forecasting community has grown substantially and is international (Sarin et al., 2020). As a result, its research output has increased exponentially. That said, the application of forecasting tools differs across communities, and today one may come across with different &lt;em&gt;schools of thought&lt;/em&gt; (Park et al., 2020). In principle, this increased diversity in the research community is positive for enhancing creativity and promoting scientific developments. However, some scholars point out a risk for forecasting tools, as their adoption increases by the different communities, the rigor in their implementation may decrease (Durance and Godet, 2010; Hasson and Keeney, 2011; Morgan, 2014).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Parallel to developments in technological forecasting methods, scholars in other fields related to innovation have produced theories which have greatly increased our understanding of how technology is developed and commercialized. Among other advancements, recent developments in innovation systems (Markard, 2020) and the multi-level perspective (Geels et al., 2017) hold, in principle, more explanatory power than older linear models based on technology-push and market-pull forces. Economic geographers have worked extensively on industrial clusters (Buenstorf and Costa, 2018) and economic complexity (Hidalgo, 2021) theories which may be used to predict patterns of regional growth and technological specialization. Sociologists and psychologists have deepened our understanding of how individual preferences, combined with environmental factors, affect technology adoption and diffusion (Bonnin Roca and O’Sullivan, 2020; Penttilä et al., 2020).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Despite these theoretical advances, much of the forecasting literature remains close to its roots and focuses only on the development of ad-hoc methods, without providing a proper theoretical substantiation of their methodological choices or of their observed results. This limits the generalizability of forecasting research, and lowers the validity and reliability of a large portion of the body of work. In other words, it is challenging to assess &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; a certain method or model works (or not), and &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to assess ex-ante the quality of a forecast, beyond common statistical measures. These problems might be exacerbated in the future with the use of forecasting methods based on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) such as deep learning (Shrestha et al., 2021) or neural networks (Liébana-Cabanillas et al., 2018), which suffer from the ‘black box’ (Castelvecchi, 2016) problem of not being able to offer a transparent explanation of how they work.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This Special Issue aims to increase the rigor in forecasting practice, by enhancing the theoretical substantiation of the most commonly used forecasting techniques. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;The development of theoretically-backed arguments for the selection of forecasting models, including scientometrics&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Interdisciplinary work aimed at reconciling results from forecasting practice with results from other disciplines&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Provision of theoretical underpinnings to the different sources of uncertainty in a forecast, and their expected evolution in time&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Development of theoretical criteria to assess, ex-ante, the quality of a forecast&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Creation of generalizable guidelines for data cleaning and processing, based on theoretical grounds&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Work devoted to the harmonisation of forecasting practices across different communities of researchers and practitioners&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Studies related to the individual, organizational, and cultural factors to take into account when conducting judgmental methods, and their expected effect on forecast accuracy&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;The revision of forecasts already published in the literature to explain why they were successful (or failed), based on existing theory&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Papers in this Special Issue may use both qualitative and quantitative research methods. In any case, papers are expected to have a solid theoretical foundation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special Issue workshop&lt;/strong&gt;: We plan to organize a hybrid, one-day development workshop for the special issue at Eindhoven University of Technology, on November 27&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, 2023. Authors interested in participating are encouraged to send their extended abstracts to the guest editors. Word limit for extended abstracts is 1000 words, excluding references. Guest editors will then invite authors of a selection of papers to this workshop to discuss their papers, although all submissions to the SI need to go through the journal’s review process later.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Please direct questions about the submission process, or any administrative matter, to the guest editors. Questions about expectations, requirements, and the appropriateness of a topic should be directed to the guest editors of the special issue.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;All the submissions should follow the general author guidelines of Technological Forecasting &amp; Social Change available at&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/journals/technological-forecasting-and-social-change/0040-1625/guide-for-authors\"&gt;https://www.elsevier.com/journals/technological-forecasting-and-social-change/0040-1625/guide-for-authors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Full-length papers should be submitted through the journal’s online submission system before June 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt;, 2024.

In the current operating environment, it is also critical to evaluate how the use of such technologies can help businesses cope with the recessionary pressures and tightening monetary regimes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;In this paradigm, in which companies begin to adopt emerging technologies to improve their business models, sustainability has become one of the most considered variables in the scientific literature in recent years (Stuermer et al., 2017). Sustainability allows firms not only to adopt new forms of development and sustainable production, but also optimizes any action that the firm develops with the aim of being profitable and respecting the environment (Whelan and Fink, 2016). In an ecosystem in which emerging technologies and their applications are essential for business growth, sustainability is a variable that must be considered to boost innovation. There are many studies that focus on analyzing the adoption and emerging technologies as well as sustainable strategies in companies, however, from a scientific point of view, the linking of both concepts allows us to understand these relevant issues from a new digital landscape (Khan et al., 2021).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Therefore, this Special Issue aims to cover this field of research by evaluating theoretical or practical contributions, mixed approaches, reviews, empirical or qualitative studies. For this Special Issue, we invite paper contributions related to any of the topics outlined above and which clearly relate to emerging technologies applications in a data-drive era of sustainability across various verticals of business (marketing, finance, supply chain, operations etc).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topics &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Adoption of emerging technologies across business verticals&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Digital sustainability strategies amidst recessionary pressures.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Innovation in sustainability&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Technological innovation&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Use of artificial intelligence approaches in sustainable companies&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Theoretical perspectives of emerging technologies and their applications&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Development of sustainable business models&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Use of emerging technologies applied to business models.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manuscript submission information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important Dates: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Call for papers: January 2023&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Submission deadline: 31st December 2023&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Submission Starts: 1st of April 2023&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;All submissions will go through the journal’s standard peer-review process.

        "explain": "&lt;p&gt;It has been 15 years since Second Life and other ubiquitous and pervasive online spaces sparked a great deal of interest in metaverses (Papagiannidis et al., 2007). Millions of users interact with one another in a virtual world, either using their existing identities in the physical world or more often than not, through new virtual identities which might not even be remotely linked to the identities of the players in the physical world. This has led to speculation that we are on the verge of a new development that is going to be as significant as the Internet itself (Kaplan and Haenlein, 2009). This early cyberspace lost its momentum as early attempts did not live up to the expectations of the hype generated.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Savvas Papagiannidis,&lt;br&gt;Newcastle University Business School, UK&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ewelina Lacka,&lt;br&gt;University of Edinburgh Business School, UK&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yann Truong,&lt;br&gt;Burgundy School of Business, France&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ben Marder,&lt;br&gt;University of Edinburgh Business School, UK&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ariana Polyviou,&lt;br&gt;School of Business of the University of Nicosia, Cyprus&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jonas Colliander,&lt;br&gt;Center for Retailing at the Stockholm School of Economics, Sweden&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ilias Pappas,&lt;br&gt;University of Agder (UiA), Norway&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jan Kietzmann,&lt;br&gt;Gustavson School of Business at the University of Victoria, Canada&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Giray Gozgor,&lt;br&gt;School of Management, University of Bradford, UK&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special issue information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;It has been 15 years since Second Life and other ubiquitous and pervasive online spaces sparked a great deal of interest in metaverses (Papagiannidis et al., 2007). Millions of users interact with one another in a virtual world, either using their existing identities in the physical world or more often than not, through new virtual identities which might not even be remotely linked to the identities of the players in the physical world. This has led to speculation that we are on the verge of a new development that is going to be as significant as the Internet itself (Kaplan and Haenlein, 2009). This early cyberspace lost its momentum as early attempts did not live up to the expectations of the hype generated.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Much has changed since then, with the emergence of breakthrough technologies, increasing computing power, Internet broadband capacity, and the emergence and dominance of social platforms in governing exchanges between individuals. Both the technological landscape and social environment are now better prepared for the development of metaverses. Deep learning can provide powerful algorithms for the governance of virtual institutions, cloud computing and superfast broadband, allowing the massive computational data necessary for virtual exchanges. Blockchain technologies (e.g., Non-Fungible Tokens and virtual currencies) can replace real-world currencies, and the dominance of social platforms means that individuals are familiar with, and ready to accept, virtual worlds. The maturity of technologies, including extended-reality, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, blockchains, computer vision, edge and cloud computing and mobile networks, is currently driving the developments and the wider use of metaverses (Lee et al., 2021). Enhanced accessibility, the wider use of mobile technologies, social distancing due to the pandemic and the need for alternative ways of investing are some of the drivers of recent interest in the metaverse beyond the maturity of related technologies and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;With recent predictions that the market will be worth up to 5 trillion USD&lt;a name=\"_ftnref1\" href=\"https://star.elsevier.net/admin/tasks/#_ftn1\" title=\"\"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; and tech giants’ announcements of investment plans, there can be little debate that the metaverses have the potential for significant developments in the near future. Indeed, Facebook announced that it was renaming itself to Meta&lt;a name=\"_ftnref2\" href=\"https://star.elsevier.net/admin/tasks/#_ftn2\" title=\"\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting its intention to enhance its online social experiences into three dimensions and enabling users to complete activities that they cannot do in the physical world. At the same time, Microsoft announced the release of Mesh&lt;a name=\"_ftnref3\" href=\"https://star.elsevier.net/admin/tasks/#_ftn3\" title=\"\"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt; for Teams, aiming to elevate meeting experiences by offering mixed reality capabilities. These initiatives have renewed interest in the opportunities afforded by virtual spaces and the value they can generate for their users including the ability to communicate with one another, build avatars and feel ‘present’ in the new space as they explore virtual worlds where they can participate in activities ranging from games and entertainment to commerce, work, and education. It is not surprising that some scholars argue that the emergence of MetaSocieties as parallel societies is an inexorable phenomenon, such that every user (i.e. individual and organization) will have its virtual counterpart (Wang, Qin, Wang, &amp; Hu, 2022).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Some innovative firms have already joined metaverse-like environments. For example, Nike has introduced its metaverse store which has been visited by approximately 7 million users worldwide (The Drum, 2022). Nike is not the only retailer that joined the hype; beauty (e.g. Estée Lauder) and fashion brands (e.g. Dolce &amp; Gabbana), automotive (e.g. BMW), and consumer goods firms (e.g. Coca-Cola) all showed their excitement to join a new virtual environment where they can not only provide consumers with immersive experience but also sell virtual goods or tokens. At the same time, safety, privacy, and data security issues are of concern, and thus individual users and organizations alike are polarized in their prediction whether metaverse will indeed revolutionise the way users interact virtually.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Considering the above, we are, once more, faced with the question as to whether a three-dimensional immersive environment is the way forward when it comes to our online interactions. While new exciting metaverse implementations are expected in the near future, the use of metaverses is expected to disrupt the way we interact in the virtual world and bring notable implications for businesses and society (Dwivedi et al., 2022; Polyviou &amp; Pappas, 2022). Multiverses are likely to transform entire business sectors, but as with the rise of social media in the previous decade, it will also come with great challenges, ranging from social issues relating to trust, privacy, bias, disinformation, the application of law as well as psychological aspects linked to addiction and the impact on vulnerable people (Dwivedi et al., 2022), to economic issues involving potential massive frauds (Smaili &amp; de Rancourt-Raymond, 2022). Reflecting on our progress and evaluating our current position can make it possible to assess the challenges and the opportunities ahead, which is a timely and necessary task given the imminent emergence of metaverse platforms at scale.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Our special issue aims to go beyond the current hype and calls for more empirical works that offer valuable theoretical and practical insights into business and social opportunities and challenges. Recognising that theory and theoretical developments are essential for understanding how research progresses, knowledge accumulates and how research fields evolve (Rabetino et al, 2021), this call aims to encourage the synthesis and extension of an explosive accumulation of research that will trigger new research questions concerning novel opportunities and challenges the new virtual worlds can present. Although this can contain some review of the literature, submissions should go beyond systematic and other reviews and utilise fresh conceptual and methodological avenues for further development of the field. While theory building is the first step before theory testing (Thomas and Snow, 1994), testing theories can also set new research directions. Indeed, empirical research can provide a significant theoretical contribution by being robust in theory building (Colquitt and Zapata-Phelan, 2007). To that end, research methods such as interviews and observations of the metaverse users as well as experimental research can prove to be a useful starting point for theorising and proposing new avenues for research (Boer et al., 2015; Thomas and Snow, 1994). Both theoretical and early empirical research should offer practical value (Ketchen and Hult, 2011).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Topics of submission include, but are not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Social dynamics on metaverses, with a potential focus on trust&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;The role of new technologies (blockchain, quantum computing, virtual reality, augment reality etc.) in the construction and development of metaverses&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Metaverses for sustainable societies&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Governance and regulation for the use of metaverses&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;New institutions in metaverses&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Community building and membership&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Designing artifacts for the metaverse&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;User behaviour and experience in the metaverse&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Psychological aspects in human behaviour in the metaverse&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Implications on user identity, sense of ‘self’, social interactions, well-being and communities&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Virtual consumption, payments &amp; NFTs, and financial innovation&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Factors driving individuals, B2C and B2B firms adoption&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Metaverses and new business models (e.g., platform based with a focus on B2B relationships)&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Disruptive innovation in the metaverse environment&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Marketing opportunities and challenges (e.g., with regards to content marketing or branding)&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Entrepreneurship in the Metaverses, new skills and the future of work and collaboration&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;The ‘dark side’ of metaverses: Illegal activities and unintended consequences&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Security, privacy, bias, and disinformation issues in the metaverse&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Ethical issues related to the use of metaverses&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The above-mentioned research areas can be contextualised in any industry or sector (e.g. entertainment, office work, manufacturing, retailing, health, education, tourism etc).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biographies &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Savvas Papagiannidis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Prof Papagiannidis is the David Goldman Professor of Innovation and Enterprise at Newcastle University Business School. His research interests revolve around electronic business and its various sub-domains and how digital technologies can transform organisations and societies alike.

His work puts strong emphasis on innovation, new value creation and exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities, within the context of different industries. Apart from the impact that the Internet and related technologies can have on businesses, he is also very much interested in the impact such technologies can have on individual users.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ewelina Lacka&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Ewelina is a Reader in Digital Marketing &amp; Analytics at the University of Edinburgh, UK.

Organizations face a variety of strategic challenges related to innovation, digital marketing, business intelligence, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The business landscape is becoming more complex for small businesses due to the challenges of a global marketplace, swiftly changing technology, aggregated purchasing and competitive pressures. A growing number of businesses are negotiating this complexity by joining or forming networks to tackle the scale and capability limits inherent in operating a small business.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Digital networks are a largely underdeveloped resource in the business world and a strategic choice when businesses face complex issues in the domestic, interstate and international marketplace (Dongquin et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2022). The logic is compelling - building on the strengths of others while nurturing one's own business strengths can help gain competitive advantage (Kraus et al., 2022; Dwivedi et al., 2020) .&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;There is a large number of studies that analyze the relationship between business intelligence systems and innovation in organizations (Zhu et al., 2022; Wimelius et al., 2021). The importance of digital transformation in decision-making lies in the possibility of decreasing uncertainty, thereby contributing to a more rational decision-making process. Digital transformation has a direct effect on performance in general and on innovation in particular (Alalwan et al., 2021; Baiyere et al., 2020; Davison and Tarafdar, 2018; Majchrzak et al., 2016; Sebastian et al., 2017).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Submissions can be from different theoretical perspectives and can use different empirical methods, large scale survey work and archival databases, but must constitute new ideas, that genuinely advance existing debates.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Topics&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;- Theoretical perspectives of digital transformation&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;- Digital marketing&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;- Digital tools for startups&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;- Big data&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;- Business intelligence&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;- Sustainable-development objectives and digital transformation&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;- Digital transformation&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;- Impact of digital transformation of human resource management&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;- Introduction of artificial intelligence technologies in firms&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;- New technologies and business networks programs&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;- Creation of firm value thorough collaborative technologies&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;- Social networks and transformation of community relationships&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;- Emergent platforms and services in the enterprise environment&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manuscript submission information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;All submissions will go through the journal’s standard peer-review process.

Submission to the conference: 30 April 2023 (optional)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Submission to the TF&amp;SC system: 31 March 2024&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hao Tan, Jin-Su Kang, Mei-Chih Hu, Scott Cunningham&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This special issue of &lt;em&gt;Technological Forecasting and Social Change&lt;/em&gt; aims to bring scholarships together to advance research on the interrelationships among contemporary geopolitical trends, technology, and the society, in particular in different economic, institutional and political contexts. For last two decades, scholars have discussed geopolitics and technology based on the assumption of globalization and global interdependence (e.g. Montobbio &amp; Sterzi, 2013). From this lens, the main focus was often to close the gap between developed and less developed regions and the important role that technology plays in the process (Stigliz, 2003). However, the Covid-19 pandemic, the recent&lt;a name=\"_Hlk113892132\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Russia-Ukraine war, and the continuing geopolitical tension between China and the West have significantly challenged these assumptions. When competition on technologies of energy, cyber-physical system, healthcare, and semiconductors is increasingly at the centre of international politics, geopolitics, by all means, is crucial in reshaping technology, manpower, capital, commodity, and information flows in the world. There is an urgent need to improve our understandings on dynamic interactions between and among technology, economics, institution, and society in this new era of geopolitics.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Changing geopolitics landscape are thus multifaceted. On one hand, technological changes are important factors in geopolitical considerations. For example, the replacement of coal with oil as the fuel of the battleships of the British Royal Navy before the WWI led to significant elevation of geopolitical importance of oil producing nations, such as Persia (now Iran) while the emergence of widely applied hydrogen technology is constructing another wave of geopolitical issue (Yergin, 2011; Rystad Energy, 2020).More recently, there have been intensive discussions on how technological changes in various areas, such as energy (Goldthau et al., 2019), health (Bollyky, et al., 2021; Kahl &amp; Wright, 2021), or metaverse technology (Eurasia Group 2021; Wong et al., 2022) may reshape and reconfigure geopolitics.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, geopolitical tensions and rising nationalism influence future technological development. For instance, the US has recently passed the “Chips and Science Act” aiming to ensure American leadership in semiconductor research, development, and production. The proposed “Chip 4” semiconductor alliance promotes cooperation among American, Japanese, South Korean and Taiwanese chipmakers while deliberately excluding China. China’s Belt and Road Initiative includes technical cooperation as a key component (Normile, 2017). Facing energy crisis, the European Union proposed a “Critical Raw Materials Act” to build up green tech markets and avoid the overdependence on a small number of fossil fuel suppliers. These initiatives foreshadow that future technological development is increasingly influenced by geopolitical divisions in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs, cooperate managers and policy makers in the world would respond to the geopolitical challenges differently in their technological development and innovation activities. This is because of their different positions in the geopolitical contests and in the global value chains. For example, China is in a direct technology “cold war” with the West, which is a critical component of their broader geological rivalry (Tan &amp; Yang, 2021). Europe Union, Japan, Korea and Taiwan are not only close allies of the US, but also technological powerhouses which, meanwhile, have close interconnections with China in their supply chains. There are also a large number developing and emerging economies that are seeking technological catch-up for economic and social development.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The geopolitical risks and the resultant increase of nationalism may hamper or exploit technology in unexpected ways (e.g., Scholten &amp; Bosman, 2016; Wang et al., 2021). Given the multidisciplinary nature of the topics, we invite manuscripts from various scholarly domains including, but not limited to, innovation and technological management, international business, strategic management, international political economy, political science, economics, finance, and entrepreneurship, for better understanding and managing technology under the changing geopolitical landscape. Both theoretical and empirical papers are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Suggested topics and research questions can include, but are not restricted to:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;How is technology influencing global decoupling?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;How can we better understand the changing geopolitics landscape from various technology fields including energy, metaverse, cyber-physical system, healthcare, semiconductor?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Do geopolitical risks affect the consumption and production patterns of energy sources in relation to fossil fuels to renewables?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;What role do political regimes play in affecting technology policy and governance?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;How can a nation state best promote its own technological sovereignty amid geopolitical challenges?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;What are the respective roles of the state and the private sectors in sourcing new technology in the changing geopolitics landscape?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;How do geopolitical risks influence global technology politics and markets?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;How does geopolitical tensions influence technology adoption?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;How does technology worsen or mitigate geopolitical tensions?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;How do different political systems and governance arrangements respond to geopolitical challenges in technology?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special Issue workshop&lt;/strong&gt;: We plan to organize a paper development workshop for the special issue during the Technological Forecasting and Social Change Special Conference in Taiwan between 28 Oct and 30 Oct 2023.

System dynamics theory considers that complex systems are composed of elements, parts, or subsystems, whose interaction lead to diverse system evolutionary paths (Bergek, 2019; Russell and Smorodinskaya, 2018; Zhao et al., 2018; Walters et al., 2016; Bergek et al., 2008; Sterman, 2001). Zhao et al. (2018) and Sterman (2000) conclude that effective understanding of technological systems, in a world of growing dynamic complexity, requires us to become systems thinkers-to expand the boundaries of our mental models and develop tools to understand how the structure of complex systems creates their patterns. System Dynamics has a strong tradition on forecasting and evaluation the evolution of social systems, such as tourism (Torres et al, 2021), healthcare workforce (Willis et al, 2018), either alone or combined with scenarios (Kunc and O’Brien, 2017).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI), and more specifically machine learning (ML) has grown significantly in the last years. Arranz et al. (2021), Huo and Chaudhry (2021), Gruetzemacher et al. (2021), Salminen et al. (2019) and Minbashian et al. (2010) have pointed out that applying Machine Learning (ML) techniques allow addressing complex modelling with a high level of accuracy. First, the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs), for example, permits determining all interactions, using learning algorithms. Second, technological systems and forecasting problems usually involve a large amount of data and many variables (Russell et al., 2018), making machine learning the best approach. Last, machine learning responds to situations where there is a lack of data, or in a variety of formats, or the lack of definition of relationship models between variables. Therefore, these techniques will allow researchers to solve previous limitations of classical statistical models, providing a higher level of explanatory variance, which will result in a better understanding and quantification of how various input variables affect the development of technological systems, forecasting, and dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;In this context, Zhao et al. (2018), Sterman et al. (2015), Liu et al. (2015), Gruetzemacher et al. (2021) and Mendoza et al. (2014) have highlighted the importance of approaching technological processes and decisions from a broader perspective, considering their complexity and evolution. While, SD models provide a high-level understanding of the processes and aid in designing policies to achieve specific system behaviours, AI, and particularly ML techniques benefit the modelling process by saving on resources, improving the potential to provide insights into the system and preventing subjectivity of the modeller (Shrestha et al., 2021; Garbero et al., 2021; Jana et al., 2021; Gruetzemacher et al., 2021). Therefore, a combination of SD with AI will lead to addressing technological systems, forecasting and planning with greater accuracy and robustness.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This special issue intends to publish research that combines systems dynamics and artificial intelligence in its application to forecasting of technological systems. We welcome research leading to empirical papers (e.g. case studies, experiments, surveys, models) and theoretical (e.g. conceptual or literature review). First, the special issue prioritizes the empirical papers, which combine SD with ML methods, developing qualitative and quantitative analysis. This combination will facilitate not only to address the classic problems of process simulation, but also to address other typical aspects of technological systems, where feedback causality, or complex nonlinear dynamics, complementarities, substitution effects, characterization of the effect of policies, are key drivers of their evolution and difficult to forecast. Second, the special issue also admits conceptual papers and reviews, prioritizing those that use combining SD with machine learning techniques (for example, natural language and polarity analysis). Finally, the scope of the special issue is opened to a wide spectrum of areas and sectors, such as environmental problems, innovation systems, smart supply chain models, technological startup processes, and transportation systems, among others. We address the following non-exhaustive list of research questions:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;How can Systems Dynamics and AI simulations be employed for forecasting complex problems?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;How can Systems Dynamics and AI simulations provide an understanding of innovation and eco-innovation systems?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;How can Systems Dynamics and AI simulations be employed to assess collaborative innovation impact on the innovation systems?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;How can Systems Dynamics and AI simulations help in the understanding of technological problems?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;How can Systems Dynamics and AI simulations be applied to the planning of technological systems?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;How can Systems Dynamics and AI simulations be applied to the analysis of technology impacts in the environmental systems?&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Thus, we aim that the collection of papers in this special issue will help the ongoing dialogue among scholars from a diverse set of disciplines that share an interest in the application de Systems Dynamics and AI to forecasting and planning processes. We also hope that the special issue will help develop a unified body of knowledge on the topic. In addition, we hope this special issue will offer decision and policy-makers some guidance to assess the conditions under which the use of AI can add value to managers and policy-makers.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Submission process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Technological Forecasting Social Changes publishes articles of a multi-disciplinary and interdisciplinary nature as well as empirical research from within traditional disciplines and managerial functions. With contributions from around the globe, the Journal includes articles across the full range of business and management disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This is an open call and will be widely advertised across the several networks the Guest editors belong to. The Guest Editors will first screen the papers and will desk-reject the papers that do not fit with the call for papers. The remaining papers will be regularly refereed by three reviewers according to the usual standards of the Journal. The Guest editors will review the report and make a proposal of the accepted papers.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;High-quality papers that do not make the final set of papers for the special issue may be considered for publication in a regular issue of the journal.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;For more information, please contact &lt;strong&gt;Marta F.

        "explain": "&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the digital economy (DE) is a key economic development direction, and artificial intelligence (AI) is a critical strategic tool of DE. “AI-assisted economy” has emerged as a new economic paradigm, widely accepted by governments around the world, and is regarded as one of the most important implementations of DE. Thus, the development of digital economy-oriented artificial intelligence (DE-oriented AI) technologies has not only theoretical significance but also practical value. DE-oriented AI technologies are distinct from general AI technologies in that they are theories, methods, algorithms, and software to promote the economic development or transformation in a digital manner.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;DE is the main economic form after the agricultural economy and the industrial economy, of which the typical characteristics are (1) treating the data resources as key elements, (2) integrating information and communication technologies, (3) using modern information network as main carrier, and (4) leveraging all-factor digital transformation as an important economic driving force. The viewpoint that is generally accepted by academic and industrial communities is that data, algorithms, and computing power are three essential aspects of AI.  In fact, these three elements are connected with the first three characteristics of DE: the data are the core element of both AI and DE; AI algorithms should be built based on the integration of information and communication technologies; and the improvement of computing power needs the support of modern information network to implement cross-cluster computing. The fourth characteristic of DE is precisely the AI's contribution to DE.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Although AI and DE have received increasing attention, there are some bottlenecks for AI applications in DE. For example, how to train an efficient big AI model with relatively low computational resource consumption, how to use advanced AI technologies to intellectualize economic activities, and how to formalize the relationship between DE and AI. Thus, there is a large opportunity to investigate reliable, robust and efficient DE-oriented AI technologies. To share the most recent advances, current challenges and potential applications of Theories and Methods for DE-oriented AI, we are delighted and honored to propose this special issue of Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://api.journals.elsevier.com/media/zqvnmaor/yulin-he.jpg\" alt=\"\"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Yulin He (Executive Guest Editor)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Guangdong Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Economy (SZ), Shenzhen 518107, China&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Email: yulinhe@gml.ac.cn&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Areas of Expertise: Data mining and machine learning algorithms and their applications; Approximate and intelligent computing technologies for big data; Theories and methods of multi-sample statistical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://api.journals.elsevier.com/media/pycl4bi0/philippe-fournier-viger.jpg\" alt=\"\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinguished Prof. Philippe Fournier-Viger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Big Data Institute, College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, China&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Email: philfv@szu.edu.cn&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Areas of Expertise: Data mining; Pattern mining; Artificial intelligence; Big data.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://api.journals.elsevier.com/media/h22f3ztw/sebastian-ventura.jpg\" alt=\"\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prof. Sebastian Ventura&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Department of Computer Science and Numerical Analysis, University of Córdoba, Spain&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Email: sventura@uco.es&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Areas of Expertise: Artificial intelligence; Data science; Computational intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://api.journals.elsevier.com/media/3rchvgi3/ling-zhang.jpg\" alt=\"\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prof. Ling Zhang&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;School of Credit Management, Guangdong University of Finance, Guangzhou 510521, China&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Email: zhangl99@gduf.edu.cn&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Areas of Expertise: Financial technology; Financial engineering and risk management; Behavioral finance.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special issue information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This special issue may include, but is not limited to, the following topics relevant to Digital Economy-Oriented Artificial Intelligence Technologies:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;1.

        "explain": "&lt;p&gt;The maritime industry is facing increasing pressure to improve efficiency in the face of growing global demand and increasingly complex operating environments. One promising area is the development of advanced machine learning to optimize various aspects of maritime operations. However, existing approaches mainly focus on classical machine learning. Therefore, the advancement of machine learning, such as deep learning, learning on graphs, deep reinforcement learning, and automatic machine learning for the maritime industry still needs to be sufficiently investigated and benchmarked. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Advanced learning algorithms facilitate intelligent decision-making in maritime applications, such as vessel trajectory mining, maritime traffic flow forecasting, shipping market modeling, etc. Moreover, maritime data are usually time-varying, high-dimensional, imperfect, non-Euclidean, or noisy, which challenges developing advanced learning algorithms.

        "explain": "&lt;p&gt;Machinery diagnostics and prognostics are involved in several engineering areas, such as manufacturing, energy, transportation, and aerospace. In these areas, the failure of key components such as bearings, gears, and motors will have a serious negative impact on the operation of the entire equipment. Timely detection of faults in machinery can ensure operational efficiency and quality, and prevent catastrophic accidents.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;With the development of sensor technology and communication technology, machinery diagnostics and prognostics have entered the era of big data. The combination of artificial intelligence technology and big data has significantly improved the accuracy of machinery diagnostics and prognostics. Artificial intelligence technology makes it possible to mine information about the health status of equipment directly from the raw data, but the distribution of the data is a key factor in determining the effectiveness of data mining. For example, data imbalance, a real and unavoidable data distribution in the field of machinery diagnostics and prognostics, can seriously impact the training process and the convergence correctness of diagnostic and prognostic models. Therefore, it is important to eliminate the negative effects of data imbalance when constructing machinery diagnostics and prognostics models in order to improve the accuracy of diagnostics and prognostics in practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence has received increasing attention for machinery diagnostics and prognostics in recent years. However, there are still some outstanding issues that need to be improved.

        "summary": "metaheuristics-for-sustainable-supply-chain-management",
        "explain": "&lt;p&gt;There are several entities involved in a supply chain network such as human resource, transportation and logistics systems, distribution centres, producers, vendors, warehouses, retailers, etc. The efficient and reliable functioning of all the associated activities help the organizations reduce the cost, maintain desired quality and grow in the competitive market. Several researchers from academia and industry have modelled the associated problems which inherently involve continuous and discrete variables, soft and hard constraints, and conflicting objectives. In the recent times, metaheuristics are becoming more popular due to their simple mathematical formulations and applicability in wider class of problems. They are inspired from the intelligence and phenomena in nature and are broadly classified into Bio-inspired, Physics based, Socio-inspired as well as Swarm based methods. The applicability of metaheuristics in solving numerous types of problems from the supply chain management is already proven; however, it is necessary to address the problems involving uncertainty especially with an aim to post COVID scenario. The issue intends to invite novel and modified metaheuristics for solving the supply chain management problems with the goal of addressing resilience, sustainability and efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Anand Kulkarni (Managing Guest Editor)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;MIT World Peace University, Pune, India&lt;br&gt;Email: &lt;a href=\"mailto:Anand.j.kulkarni@mitwpu.edu.in\"&gt;Anand.j.kulkarni@mitwpu.edu.in&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Patrick Siarry&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Université Paris-Est Creteil, France&lt;br&gt;Email: &lt;a href=\"mailto:siarry@u-pec.fr\"&gt;siarry@u-pec.fr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special issue information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;It can accommodate the original contributions from within the below domains (not limited to):&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ol&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Novel constraint handling methods in nature inspired methods&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Novel or modified metaheuristics for solving discrete and combinatorial problems&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Metaheuristics for multi-objective problems&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Metaheuristic solutions to enhance process efficiency and sustainability&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Optimization methods for facility layout, location and distribution&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Metaheuristics for handling uncertainty and risk mitigation in the supply chain&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Metaheuristics solutions for adaptation and resilience to supply chain&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Nature inspired optimization methods in production, manufacturing and logistics&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ol&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manuscript submission information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tentative Schedule&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;First Submission Date: 1st October 2022&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Final Submission Deadline: 30th April 2023&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Notification of Acceptance: 1st July 2023&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Manuscripts must be submitted via the &lt;em&gt;Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence&lt;/em&gt; online submission system (Editorial Manager&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;): &lt;a href=\"https://www.editorialmanager.com/eaai/default1.aspx\"&gt;https://www.editorialmanager.com/eaai/default1.aspx&lt;/a&gt;.

        "biography": "My brain-computer interface (BCI) research is aimed at devising an effective communication link between human brain and computing devices for two main purposes. The first is to enable people with extreme physical disability to interact with assistive devices or their environment, even in case of complete breakdown of neuro-muscular pathway, e.g. people suffering from MND or spinal cord injuries (SCIs). The second is to help people with disabilities due to stroke or SCI in functional recovery, by facilitating active rehabilitation exercises. Novel BCI systems have successfully been developed and trialled for operating assistive robotic devices as well as for active mental practice of rehabilitation tasks as explained below:&lt;br&gt;o As part of pilot trials, healthy individuals successfully operated a robotic device through thinking and results have been published in a high quality journal IEEE Transactions on Man, Systems and Cyber (cf. [23]). This work is now being extended to develop a multi-modal BCI system for manoeuvring a smart wheel-chair and operating a virtual keyboard [cf. [6]).&lt;br&gt;A pilot trial of our BCI supported mental practice system was conducted on five chronic stroke sufferers. All the participants showed some functional recovery reaching minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in some cases, and the results have been published in a high impact factor Journal of Neuroengineering and Rehabilitation (cf. [24]). At that time, ours was the only second BCI lab that conducted trials on stroke sufferers and published the results in a journal paper, which has been receiving lots of citations. It was also instrumental in the UKIERI research grant awards for investigating &ldquo;A BCI Operated Hand Exoskeleton based Neuro-rehabilitation System for Movement Restoration in Paralysis&rdquo;. Under this grant, a rehab protocol has been developed incorporating an active physical practice (PP) stage followed by a mental practice (MP) stage, using a neurorehab system consisting of a hand exoskeleton and an EEG/EEG-EMG based BCI. It has been trialled on groups of chronic stroke patients both at IIT Kanpur India and ISRC UK. As a result of trials, the stroke participants have reported transformative change in their quality of life, particularly in the recovery of hand motor functions. The results have been published in high impact international journals (cf. [1], [2], [5], [9], [10] &amp; [16]). This work has further led to the award of the third UKIERI grant: Advancing MEG based Brain-Computer Interface Supported Upper Limb Post-Stroke Rehabilitation.&lt;br&gt; I am also the Director of the Northern Ireland Functional Brain Mapping (NIFBM) facility which houses a state-of-the-art 306-channel Elekta magneto-encephalography (MEG) system at ISRC, and thus the team has a direct access to an MEG recording device, which can record simultaneously high density (128-channel) EEG and MEG. I have established a clinical collaboration with Beaumont Hospital, Dublin through Neurophysiologist Dr Ronan Kilbride for MEG-based pre-surgical evaluation of epileptic patients going forward for surgical intervention. A collaborative project was undertaken with Professor Peter Passmore of Royal Victoria hospital and Centre for Public Health, Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast for MEG studies in Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease. Dr Stephen Todd of Altnagelvin Hospital, Derry was also involved in this project. A pilot trial on a group of MCI/AD patients is ongoing since Sept&rsquo;17 at the NIFBM facility.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;"

        "summary": "neural-networks-for-game-theoretic-intelligent-decision-making",
        "explain": "&lt;p&gt;In intelligent decision making, a decision maker must decide on what actions to execute in order to achieve goals in an environment. A decision maker (or an agent) can be artificial intelligence (AI) or a human. In recent years, significant improvements in neural networks and machine learning have spurred the usage of AI in many real-world decision-making problems, such as autonomous driving, gaming, and border testing against pandemics. The outcomes of these problems can depend on the decisions of a single agent, or the joint decisions of two or more agents. The former is traditional single-agent decision making, while the latter is the increasingly popular multi-agent decision-making setting.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Game theory provides a mathematical framework to model strategic interactions among multiple agents. The modern study of multi-agent decision making, thereby, often combines game theory, machine learning and neural networks. Neural networks empower decision making with efficient representation learning. On the other hand, game theory lays theoretical underpinnings and sheds light on the outcomes of multi-agent decision making.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The goal of this special issue is to promote collaboration and the cross-fertilization of ideas between researchers working from different aspects of game theory, intelligent decision making, machine learning and neural networks. We welcome both original theory- and application-driven contributions to this field, and we particularly encourage work in machine learning and neural networks for multi-agent decision making.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://api.journals.elsevier.com/media/23zfgqgt/zhen-wang.png\" alt=\"\"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prof. Zhen Wang (Executive Guest Editor)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi’an, China&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Email: w-zhen@nwpu.edu.cn&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Areas of Expertise: reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, pattern recognition, games, networks&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://api.journals.elsevier.com/media/w2klzn4w/jianye-hao.png\" alt=\"\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prof. Jianye Hao&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Tianjin University, Tianjin, China&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Email: jianye.hao@tju.edu.cn&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Areas of Expertise: artificial intelligence, multi-agent systems, machine learning, game theory&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://api.journals.elsevier.com/media/djyhewuh/matthew-e.png\" alt=\"\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prof. Matthew E.

They urgently need to construct value chain digital ecosystem, which extracts insight from data systems to realize intelligent clustering. Based on intelligent data-driven theories and methods, advanced interconnected technologies and tools are used to make various links of the value chain and different entities interact and integrate dynamically according to the principle of optimal overall value, to achieve value integration, value co-creation, value chain upgrading, and to build enterprises value chain ecological network coordination. The value chain digital ecosystem illustrates manufacturing enterprises behavior, rather than rely on domain knowledge, decision-makers experience, or subjective intuition alone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, data-driven methods are rapidly reshaping the strategic framework of manufacturing enterprises in all industries and leading a paradigm shift towards an innovation-based economy based on knowledge, data, and the Internet of Things. Modern industrial production and operation processes are recorded by huge amount of heterogeneous data including sensor-based data, image-based data, and other numerical and categorical data related design, manufacturing and operation management process domain. These data are needed to analyze and extract the key information behind the data and then provide useful information and knowledge for decision making such as yield enhancement, cycle time control, defect inspection, demand forecast, fault detection, product design and predictive maintenance. Data-driven methods such as artificial intelligence, big data analytic and machine learning learn from data to drive better decisions, which providing support for building value chain ecosystem. With various data, manufacturing enterprises can uncover patterns and relationships behind the data, which allows decision makers to anticipate outcomes based upon more concrete information than an assumption.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the interpretable models and results are also important to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of enterprises collaborations to empower operations excellence, smart manufacturing and value creation. Well established machine learning and mathematical models for production/process engineering must be integrated with data-driven methods for cross-domain knowledge generation and representation. Artificial intelligence and other model-driven methods are main methodologies for considering in problem-oriented industrial management and decision support to empower intelligence excellence, which also facilitate the setup of ecosystem. The above study will play a major role in promoting market standardization, new technology benefits and improving production quality, leading relevant industries to promote development towards high-quality and sustainable direction.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scope&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This special issue of &lt;strong&gt;Computers &amp; Industrial Engineering&lt;/strong&gt; aims to explore, with the multiple influence of dual carbon policy, the epidemic prevention and so on, how to use intelligent data-driven theories, methods and technologies to promote value integration, value co-creation, and value chain upgrading for manufacturing enterprises, to realize enterprises value chain ecological network coordination. Empirical studies with technical and/or methodological advances to address realistic issues are encouraged.

A smart wafer fabrication facility facilitates transparent manufacturing platform by integrating technological advances in computer networks, data integration, and telecommunication to enable modeling, analytics and intelligence for smart production. On the other hand, leading nations have reemphasized the importance of domestic semiconductor manufacturing for supply chain resilience. Meanwhile, the pros and cons of wafer fabs regarding sustainability and circular economy for semiconductor manufacturing are not fully investigated in the restructuring global semiconductor manufacturing supply chains, while new technologies and intelligent solutions are needed for cleaner production.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Thus, this special issue of the &lt;em&gt;Computers &amp; Industrial Engineering&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;C&amp;IE&lt;/strong&gt;) aims to address emergent research issues involved on recent developments of intelligent manufacturing and circular economy for semiconductor manufacturing. Semiconductor manufacturing is capital intensive and very complex due to tightly constrained lengthy production processes, reentrant process flows, sophisticated equipment, volatile demands, and complicated product mix. While big data is accumulated due to the fully automated semiconductor manufacturing facilities and logistics systems for business integration, by combining equipment automation with decision technologies and exploiting useful rules and patterns from data, potential failures during the early stages can be anticipated for real-time decisions. Indeed, the intelligence and real-time decision-making capabilities of equipment coupled with the system-level fabrication automation in advanced fabs have changed the paradigm of future semiconductor manufacturing. In addition to shop-floor control concerns, supply chain management problems have become more and more important which necessitate a horizontal integration of the semiconductor supply chain and digital transformation for the industry ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Scope&lt;strong&gt; of the Special Issue&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This special issue welcomes contributions that may concern to recent advances and future perspectives describing various research areas, novel approaches, and important issues in different regions to address the needs for intelligent manufacturing and circular economy for semiconductor manufacturing. Special attentions will be paid to papers focusing on smart manufacturing and cleaner production via intelligent technologies to enhance sustainability, including the following topics and related issues:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Advanced Equipment/Process/Quality Control&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;AGV and AMHS&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Artificial Intelligence Applications for semiconductor manufacturing&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Big Data Analytics&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Circular Economy &amp; Sustainability for Semiconductor Manufacturing&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Circular Supply Chain for Semiconductor Manufacturing&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Energy Saving and Green Production&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Fault Detection and Diagnosis&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Global Manufacturing Network Coordination and Supply Chain Resilience&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Manufacturing Strategy and Semiconductor Industry Ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Modeling &amp; Decision Analysis for Semiconductor Manufacturing&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Prognostic and Health Management, Tool Intelligence and Health&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Semiconductor Manufacturing Intelligence&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Smart Fab and Future Fab for Semiconductor Manufacturing&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Solid Waste Management and Waste Water Treatment&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Virtual Metrology and Run-to-Run Control&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publication Schedule (tentative)&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline for manuscript submission: &lt;/strong&gt;31 March 2023&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review report: &lt;/strong&gt;28 April 2023&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revised paper submission deadline: &lt;/strong&gt;31 May 2023&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notification of final acceptance: &lt;/strong&gt;31 July 2023&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approximation publication date: &lt;/strong&gt;on-line first upon acceptance&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manuscript submission information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Please submit your manuscript before the submission deadline of &lt;strong&gt;31 March 2022&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Original, high quality papers and empirical research papers for the theme of the special issue are welcome, while they should not be published, submitted and/or currently under review elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Papers must conform to the manuscript guidelines provided on the journal web page and uploaded using the &lt;a href=\"https://www.editorialmanager.com/caie/default.aspx\"&gt;Editorial Manager&lt;/a&gt; online platform.

        "explain": "&lt;p&gt;In many real-world applications, e.g., fault detection, it is usually hard to avoid unbalanced data, which exhibits a skewed distribution between its classes. To address the class imbalance issue, many methods have been developed to either rebalance data or improve standard classification algorithms. Computational intelligence (CI) covers three branches, i.e., Evolutionary Computation, Fuzzy Sets, and Artificial Neural Networks. Many CI techniques have achieved great contributions to a wide range of tasks in unbalanced classification. However, there are many new challenging real-world tasks involved with more complicated unbalanced data, e.g., high-dimensional unbalanced data and streaming unbalanced data. This arises new challenges to existing methods for maintaining their effectiveness under the conditions of limited domain knowledge, human efforts, and computational resources available.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Wenbin Pei (Managing Guest Editor), Dalian University of Technology, China, &lt;a href=\"mailto:peiwenbin@dlut.edu.cn\"&gt;peiwenbin@dlut.edu.cn&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;br&gt;Dr. Bing Xue, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, &lt;a href=\"mailto:Bing.Xue@ecs.vuw.ac.nz\"&gt;Bing.Xue@ecs.vuw.ac.nz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;Dr. Yaqing Hou, Dalian University of Technology, China, &lt;a href=\"mailto:houyq@dlut.edu.cn\"&gt;houyq@dlut.edu.cn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;Dr. Mengjie Zhang, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, &lt;a href=\"mailto:mengjie.zhang@ecs.vuw.ac.nz\"&gt;mengjie.zhang@ecs.vuw.ac.nz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special issue information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;In order to address the class imbalance issue, many techniques/methods in Machine Learning have been developed to either rebalance data or improve standard classification algorithms. Sampling methods are most well-known methods at the data level, with the aim to rebalance data for guaranteeing the same or a similar number of instances per class. There are a class of dynamic sampling techniques that could be regarded as some kind of implicit sampling or weighting of training instances. Cost-sensitive learning is popular in the algorithm-level category of methods, which takes costs (mostly misclassification costs) into account. However, these existing methods may become less effective when the amount of data is big or/and various types of data are intertwined with each other.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Computational intelligence is an important sub-field of artificial intelligence, which covers three research branches, i.e., Evolutionary Computation, Fuzzy Sets, and Artificial Neural Networks. Techniques from all the three branches have been applied and achieved great contributions to a wide range of challenging tasks in unbalanced classification. In the big data era, there are many new challenging real-world tasks involved with more complicated unbalanced data, such as highdimensional&lt;br&gt;unbalanced data and streaming unbalanced data. This arises new challenges to existing&lt;br&gt;methods for maintaining their effectiveness under the conditions of limited domain knowledge, human efforts, and computational resources available. Therefore, new approaches that address those challenges are desired.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The aim of this special issue is to promote the contemporary use of theories and methodologies from different branches in computational intelligence for addressing challenging tasks and open questions in unbalanced classification.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;We welcome studies and contributions that propose novel methods based on different computational intelligence paradigms for unbalanced classification and its applications.

        "explain": "&lt;p&gt;The metaverse is a cosmos that combines physical reality with digital virtuality in a continualmulti-user environment. Metaverse is built on the convergence of technologies, such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and extended reality (XR), enabling multimodal interactions with virtual environments, digital elements, and people. A metaverse allows people to live and work in a virtual place (Pamucar et al., 2022; Hwang and Chien, 2022). In the metaverse space, people can engage in social activities such as discussing an issue, collaborating on a project, playing games, and learning from experiencing or solving some problems (Bourlakis et al., 2009; Jovanović &amp; Milosavljević, 2022; Park &amp; Kim, 2022). One's partners or friends in the metaverse could be real persons or virtual characters (Díaz et al., 2020; Kye et al., 2021). Moreover, there can be various kinds of activities or events in the metaverse just&lt;br&gt;as in the real world, such as economic activities, political events, and natural disasters (Davis et al., 2009; Díaz et al., 2020). In such a virtual world, the only limitation is people's imagination. Moreover, with the lifelogging function, the details of life in the metaverse can be fully recorded (Thawonmas &amp; Fukumoto, 2011).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.

From this framework, it can be seen that an AR or VR system could be part of the metaverse for presenting the virtual content; on the other hand, the metaverse could contain AR or VR elements plus other required elements (Hwang and Chen, SI Proposal Form2022). Moreover, decentralized technologies (e.g., blockchains) are required to ensure that economic activities can be safely conducted and that personal property and logs in the metaverse will not be modified by others (Min and Cai, 2022).&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Decision support system (DSS)-based approaches using soft computing techniques are pivotal factors in identifying business trends and emerging technologies. These progressive trends can help companies/researchers to identify connections between innovation and sustainability aimed at integrating Soft computing techniques into decision-making processes for the achievement of better applications in virtual worlds like a metaverse. With soft computing techniques, one can examine each metaverse area and make decisions most effectively and efficiently. Current AI tools are advanced enough to be integrated into decision support systems for metaverse applications and influence decision-making processes in significant ways. Building virtual worlds in the metaverse may benefit from a thorough investigation of AI-based techniques related to various technical aspects, such as natural language processing, machine vision, blockchain, networking, digital twins, and neural interface. To guarantee system interoperability, protect privacy, and integrate various services, this combination may have social effects and explore opportunities for government, business, and academic collaboration. Hence, It is necessary to investigate the stateof-the-art AI-based techniques, such as traditional ML algorithms and DL architectures, used to power various metaverse-enabling technologies: neural interface, natural language processing, machine vision, blockchain, networking, and digital twins.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;This special issue is open to new articles on soft computing-based models for metaverse applications.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.

This term refers to descriptions of massive, complex, and real-time data, including commercial big data, medical big data, industrial big data, agricultural big data, &lt;em&gt;et cetera&lt;/em&gt;. Big data analytics requires sophisticated management analysis and processing techniques to extract insights from the sources. Both data analytics and high-performance computing have made significant progress in society –changing AI applications in many areas. A great success is learning from massive amounts of data in real time to identify newly emerging unknown patterns quickly. Incomplete, inaccurate, or inconsistent data still pose a challenge for all types of data analytics. Data analysis must combine the best qualities of the human mind and computers in order to construct relevant and reliable knowledge and use it as part of a decision-making process.

The Special Issue focuses on practical problems regarding the effective use of prior knowledge both to aid decision-making, to enhance data analytics for autonomous decision-making, and to explain decision-making results. Consequently, this Special Issue aims at bringing together both researchers from academia and practitioners from industry to discuss the latest progress and launch new research topics pertaining to applications of these thriving areas.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;In this Special Issue, we will consider submissions that deal with theories and applications of three-way decision and granular computing with &lt;a name=\"OLE_LINK3\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;data analysis under uncertainty.

Among others, intelligent systems which facilitate tourists in planning their trip either ahead or while at the tourist destination have proliferated in the recent years.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Trip planning entails a particularly complex process which involves several aspects like: selecting the city or region(s) to visit; making travel arrangements in order to get at the destination and familiarizing with public transit networks to move around while being there; identifying conveniently situated and value-for-money tourist and hospitality services (lodging, food and beverage, nightlife, fun parks, shopping, etc); deciding which attractions to visit and which activities to consider. The above listed trip planning decisions are typically made based on a variety of criteria like personal preferences, time availability, cost, vacation style, spatiotemporal context, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Most often, trip planning problems are computationally expensive. Hence, the development of efficient algorithmic methods is fundamental to build intelligent systems which derive feasible and qualitative trip plans. While trip planning problems have been intensively investigated in the recent years, the algorithm engineering community still seeks intelligent algorithmic solutions to tackle various practical tourist trip requirements.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prof. Damianos Gavalas,&lt;/strong&gt; University of the Aegean, Greece, &lt;a href=\"mailto:dgavalas@aegean.gr\"&gt;dgavalas@aegean.gr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prof. Grammati Pantziou, &lt;/strong&gt;University of West Attica, Greece, &lt;a href=\"mailto:pantziou@uniwa.gr\"&gt;pantziou@uniwa.gr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prof. Charalampos Konstantopoulos,&lt;/strong&gt; University of Piraeus, Greece, &lt;a href=\"mailto:konstant@unipi.gr\"&gt;konstant@unipi.gr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ass.

In waste management, analytical approaches can be used effectively to inspect possible trade-offs among alternatives, which can help in choosing appropriate decision-making schemes. Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) has been widely used as a novel approach in the decision-making process. MCDM allows researchers to evaluate different choices with restricted resources and within a limited time. The main goal of this Special Issue is to present the readers with a group of research studies that focus on the deployment of the MCDM tools for waste management.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mehrbakhsh Nilashi, UCSI University, &lt;a href=\"mailto:nilashidotnet@hotmail.com;\"&gt;nilashidotnet@hotmail.com;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mohammad Iranmanesh, Edith Cowan University, &lt;a href=\"mailto:m.iranmanesh@ecu.edu.au;\"&gt;m.iranmanesh@ecu.edu.au;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Morteza Ghobakhloo, Kaunas University of Technology, &lt;a href=\"mailto:morteza.ghobakhloo@ktu.lt;\"&gt;morteza.ghobakhloo@ktu.lt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rabab Ali Abumalloh, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, &lt;a href=\"mailto:ramolloh@iau.edu.sa\"&gt;ramolloh@iau.edu.sa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special issue information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Wastes are created by individuals in almost all environments in different forms including liquids, gases, and solids. Wastes can be categorized, based on the source, into construction and mining, agricultural, commercial, industrial, domestic, and medical waste. Because of the variations in the deployed strategy of operation and management, each source produces a different amount of waste. For example, in the construction field, the amount of generated waste is growing in a fast manner, accounting for 35% of the overall global waste. Wastes produced from construction lead to detrimental impacts on the environment and cause huge financial losses. Industrial waste, on the other hand, entails hazardous and toxic materials that impact the health of community members. Medical waste might include several types, such as sharp materials, blood, parts of the human body, chemical materials, pharmaceutical materials, infectious materials, and health-related devices. Effective waste management strategies have a vital role in compacting the hazards associated with waste. In waste management, analytical approaches can be used effectively to inspect possible trade-offs among alternatives, which can help choose appropriate planning, operation, and decision-making schemes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;In real life, decision-making is usually a complex procedure that needs a suitable and dependable guide. In previous literature, several statistical and non-statistical approaches have been deployed for facilitating the decision-making process in complex situations. Still, the decision-making process by individuals is subject to several shortcomings in terms of prediction reliability and accuracy. Real-world decisions usually entail many-sided or multi-attribute tasks that should be performed by selecting one of the available choices within specific conditions. On the contrary to single-sided tasks, multi-attribute tasks conform to several choices with trade-offs among those choices. Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) is an efficient quantitative approach used effectively to help decision-makers reach the right choice and solve problems with many alternatives and several conditions. MCDM has been significantly extended beyond traditional approaches, providing insightful and informal procedures in the decision-making process. MCDM allows researchers to evaluate different choices with restricted resources and within a limited time. MCDM can be used to investigate several economic, environmental, and social dimensions in waste management and handle potential conflicts to provide a solution in an optimized manner. Unlike conventional MCDM approaches, fuzzy decision-making presents suitable approaches to handle ambiguities and uncertainties. The fuzzy set theory focuses on handling issues related to subjective, ambiguous, and imprecise decisions. It can measure the linguistic aspects of possible choices and alternatives to allow individual or group decision-making. The fuzzy set theory has been extended and deployed in several fields of research, entailing interval-valued fuzzy sets, intuitionistic fuzzy sets, interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets, rough sets, grey sets, bipolar fuzzy sets, hesitant fuzzy sets, fuzzy oriented sets, and fuzzy numbers. Recently, the fuzzy sets method has seen substantial development theoretically and practically. Hence, along with traditional MCDM techniques, this Special Issue invites studies that deploy the fuzzy theory, such as rough sets, fuzzy sets, neutrosophic sets in waste management. This Special Issue aims to provide new research articles on multi-criteria decisions in a multidisciplinary environment, focusing on waste management.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;The main goal of this Special Issue is to present the readers with a group of research studies that focus on the deployment of the MCDM tools for waste management. The management of possible threats that are linked to waste is also a topic of interest in this Special Issue. The domain of this Special Issue entails the deployment of emerging developments in discrete and continuous MCDM approaches to waste management. As editors, we welcome the studies that present state-of-the-art multi-criteria decision-making by utilizing the fuzzy environment to threats and risks related to the practical implementation of waste management. We welcome high-quality research articles related to the design, integration, deployment of multi-criteria decisions in waste management and operation. Scholars are welcome to submit research studies that investigate issues of multi-objective modeling of decision-making in waste management to present state-of-the-art sustainable solutions. Both empirical and review studies that can provide in-depth perceptions about the deployment of MCDM tools in waste management are welcome. The proposed research studies should provide novel MCDM systems to address waste, particularly in the following directions of research:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;MCDM modeling for waste management&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Group decision making of waste management&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;MCDM applications for waste management&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Decision making for sustainable management of waste&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Discrete and continuous MCDM approaches for waste management&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Decision support systems for waste management&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Fuzzy MCDM application for waste management&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Methods for MCDM in waste management&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;MCDM in strategic waste management&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Risk evaluation in waste management&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;MCDM soft-computing approaches for waste management&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Survey studies in MCDM approach for waste management&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;The multi-objective problem in waste management&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;The application of MCDM tools to address the increase of waste during the COVID-19 crisis&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manuscript submission information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Paper submissions for the special issue should follow the submission format and guidelines for regular papers and be submitted at https://ees.elsevier.com/asoc.

The underlying tools are intelligent enough to analyze and process real world data to extract meaningful and relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;As such, a plethora of initiatives is being explored to involve computational intelligence and allied techniques address the current impasse. The proposed techniques are mainly focused on using suitable intelligent algorithms and innovations to decipher the presence of the disease causing virus by resorting to proper modelling, early prediction and detection from data collected from infected (both symptomatic and non-symptomatic) and non-infected subjects, but also to study and prevail the expected impacts on society on long-termed lockdowns and industrial production standstills.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;\"Applied Soft Computing\" wants to respond on those pressing issues and offer a special avenue for publications with strong relation to COVID-19. Effectively starting June 1, there is a Fast Track submission option available at our journal. It will stay open until further notice.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Those Fast Track submissions will be handled by selected editors from ASOC Editorial Board in an expedited procedure. It means: at most one revision round (however, submissions rejected for such reason can still be resubmitted as regular submissions), and an envisaged processing time of at most 3 months. Submissions accepted for publication will appear in a regular volume, in a related Article Collection in ScienceDirect area of ASOC, and in Elsevier's Covid-19 Repository.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;To submit to the Fast Track, prepare it as a regular submission, but select the Article Type \"FT: Covid-19\". Note that submissions under this Article Type with no or minor relation to above themes will be rejected straight-away. Also we can make this offer only for one submission per research group or leading author, for fairness to other authors.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, general submission standards apply. Topics include but are not limited to the following:&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Intelligent Modelling of Pandemics&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Analysis of spreads and outbreaks&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Intelligent Data Analysis Tools for Pandemics&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Early Detection and Prediction Mechanisms&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Optimization of Health Care Resources and Health Care Informatics&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Intelligent multi sensing methods for automatic symptoms analysis&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Intelligent Diagnosis and Prognosis Mechanisms &lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Intelligent Modes of Health Care Measures&lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Non-invasive Testing and Treatment Provisions&lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Intelligent Models for Social Distancing and Social Interaction&lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Contact-less Human Etiquette&lt;br&gt; &lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Social influence analysis&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Track Editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Siddhartha Bhattachariya, CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Bangalore, India&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Abbas Mardani, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida, United States&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Mehrbakhsh Nilashi, University of Technology Malaysia, Skudai, Malaysia&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Francisco Palmieri, University of Salerno, Fisciano, Italy&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Ruben Gonzales Crespo, International University of Rioja - Logrono Campus, Logrono, Spain&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Enrique Herrera Viedma, University of Granada, Spain&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Pauline Ong, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia (UTHM), Johor, Malaysia&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Cristián Bravo, Western University, London, Ontario, Canada&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;p&gt;Erik Cuevas, University of Guadalajara University Center of Exact Sciences and Engineering, Guadalajara, Mexico&lt;/p&gt;",
