    "aimsAndScope": "&lt;em&gt;Energy Policy&lt;/em&gt; is an international peer-reviewed journal addressing the policy implications of energy supply and use from their economic, social, planning and environmental aspects. Papers may cover global, regional, national, or even local topics that are of wider policy significance, and of interest to international agencies, governments, public and private sector entities, local communities and non-governmental organisations. Within this broad spectrum, topics of particular interest include energy and environmental regulation, energy supply security, the quality and efficiency of energy services, the effectiveness of market-based approaches and/or governmental interventions, technological innovation and diffusion, and voluntary initiatives where the broader policy implications can be recognised. Policy prescriptions are required to be supported by rigorous analysis and balanced appraisal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Given the aims and scope of Energy Policy, all submitted papers should explicitly address policy issues involving energy supply or use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This journal welcomes contributions that support and advance the UN's &lt;a href=\"https://sdgresources.relx.com/\"&gt;sustainable development goals&lt;/a&gt;, in particular SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Special issue proposals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\nProspective guest editor(s) should submit written proposals that incorporate the rationale for the special issue topic, positions it in the literature, and include some illustrative topics and proposed contributors. Guest Editors should complete and submit this &lt;a href=\"https://www.elsevier.com/__data/promis_misc/EnergyPolicy-SpecialIssueProposalForm.docx\"&gt;Special Issue Proposal template&lt;/a&gt; to be considered for publication in the Journal.",

They should protect customers from excessive price peaks but still retain incentives for demand response and enable customers to specify the amount of flexibility which they are able to provide and ensure that this flexibility is used optimally.

The expected new loads comprise heat pumps, electric vehicles, rooftop solar, and batteries. While previous demand was rather inflexible, these new distributed energy resources can behave flexibly and provide some of the flexibility that is needed to accommodate renewables and defer network investments. Future electricity tariffs should aim to facilitate this role while providing the necessary protection for vulnerable consumers from the full risk of volatile electricity prices. The high policy relevance of tariff design is underlined by the responses of ACER and ENTSO-E to the EU consultation on future market design, both of which highlighted tariff design as a key topic for future reforms, as well as by the large amount of ongoing research in response to the energy crisis (see &lt;a href=\"https://www.esig.energy/aligning-retail-pricing-with-grid-needs/\"&gt;White-Paper Series&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://pure.uvt.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/65524792/CERRE_Retail_Energy_Markets_Under_Stress.pdf\"&gt;Report1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://ceepr.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/MIT-CEEPR-RC-2023-01.pdf\"&gt;Report2&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Special Issue “Future Electricity Tariffs” aims to improve the design and implementation of electricity tariffs. Tariffs results from a complex decision-making process as different objectives (cost recovery, efficiency, simplicity, and transparency...) tend to conflict with each other and different consumer groups may be affected in different ways by different designs. The process should therefore be addressed and analysed with a transdisciplinary approach to deal with all issues arising (quantitative, qualitative, policy design, design of indicators...). We invite submissions on the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Grid charges, energy charges and interactions between them&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Distribution network tariffs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Congestion management mechanisms at the distribution level&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tariffs for different security levels (or service priority)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Different approaches for risk hedging&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Retail competition and rules for tariff switching&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Financial hedging requirements for suppliers and other regulatory aspects&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Attractiveness of tariffs for users&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manuscript submission information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You are invited to submit your manuscript at any time before the submission deadline of &lt;strong&gt;July 31, 2023&lt;/strong&gt;.

            "description": "&lt;p&gt;Household energy consumption and climate change are highly related. On the one hand, residential energy sector has become a major energy consumption sector, responsible for significant emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) (Mi et al., 2020). According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) data, residents consumed 21% of global total final energy in 2019 (IEA, 2022). On the other hand, climate change has impacts on household energy consumption. Global temperature rise will increase energy demand for cooling and decrease energy demand for heating. In addition, household energy consumption is known to affect human well-being and can result in harmful environmental impacts. Thus, understanding the changes and dynamics of household energy consumption as well as the associated greenhouse gas emission and environmental impacts at the global and regional level will be critical for achieving climate change mitigation targets.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prof. Dr. Zhifu Mi, PhD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;University College London, London, UK&lt;br&gt;(Climate change economics, energy policy, carbon neutrality)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Lu Jiang, PhD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China&lt;br&gt;(Energy geography, regional sustainability, energy consumption)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special issue information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Recent work has identified several critical factors that affect the consumption of household energy, including household characteristics, energy prices, and energy-related policies (Wolske et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2016). Therefore, the type and amount of household energy consumption are different within and across regions and nations. In the coming years, household energy transition requires further development to achieve policy objectives and function well in climate change mitigation (Mi et al., 2020).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The special issue “Household energy consumption and climate change” aims to improve understanding on the regional diversity and effects of relevance to energy consumption in our households. This issue will provide a platform for cross-cutting analyses that inform global, national and regional climate change mitigation targets. It will provide critical advices for key stakeholders such as policy makers, practitioner, industries and households. Hence, we invite submissions on the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1. Household energy use and environmental impacts&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;- Residential mobility, space heating, and cooling energy demand&lt;br&gt;- Ecology and climate consequences of energy use&lt;br&gt;- Environmental impacts of energy use&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2. Household energy efficiency and energy conservation&lt;br&gt;- Household energy consumption behaviors&lt;br&gt;- The rebound effect on energy efficiency&lt;br&gt;- Technology innovation and household energy consumption&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3.

However, the ability of developing nations to improve the living standards of the world's poor under these conditions is a critical concern.&lt;/p&gt;",

However, the ability of developing nations to improve the living standards of the world's poor under these conditions is a critical concern.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest editors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fateh Belaïd&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center, Saudi Arabia&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ramzi Benkraiem&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Audencia Business School, France&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stéphane Goutte&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;UMI_SOURCE, University Paris-Saclay France&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khaled Guesmi&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;CRECC – Paris School of Business, France&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special issue information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After the economic ravages of COVID-19, low-income countries are experiencing a more acute and long-lasting downturn that has increased poverty around the world and reversed recent trends in reducing inequality. According to the World Bank estimations, between 88 and 115 million people fell into extreme poverty in 2020, and this figure will reach between 119 and 124 million in 2021 (WB, 2020). Further, fuel poverty is associated with cold homes and adverse health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The challenge of addressing fuel vulnerability and poor energy efficient home-related negative health impacts is fundamental to improving the quality of life of many households by making their homes warmer and more efficient (Simshauser, 2021; Simshauser, 2021). Furthermore, reducing fuel poverty could substantially enhance health outcomes, reduce inequalities in health, as well as make an essential contribution to tackling residential greenhouse emissions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the growing body of knowledge regarding fuel poverty assessment and the main factors driving fuel poverty phenomenon, gaps in the evidence remain (Bélaïd, 2018). Further research is required to investigate the fuel poor's attitudes to energy efficiency and how they perceive their energy situation (Kearns et al., 2019).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Within this context, this special issue's primary purpose is to amalgamate the high-quality research work on fuel poverty and energy vulnerability. The focus will be on the challenges, strategies, and lessons learned in recent years both in developing and developed countries. This special issue's specific objective is to understand the role of energy prices, housing characteristics, and socio-economic features in shaping the fuel poverty phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;More precisely, it aims at providing an international overview of the many facets of fuel poverty, including domestic energy consumption, well-being, behavioral change, and energy efficiency deployment as an instrument for fuel poverty mitigation. To derive policy discussion/recommendations, the special issue will contain state-of-art policy, theoretical and empirical advances to examine and document fuel poverty's economic, health, and well-being implications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A very holistic vision is more than ever necessary to combine ambitious climate policies with effort to alleviate energy poverty. The special issue will discuss innovative approaches and key policy measures to optimize lessons learned in tackling energy poverty and leverage them as the backbone of resilient and well-being economic model. Besides helping to gain a comprehensive overview of the scope of the energy poverty phenomenon, the special issue may also act as a vector to stimulate public engagement and disseminate information and best practices among policymakers, public and private stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One of the expected impact of the special issue is to help policy-makers and practitioners to navigate the global fuel poverty agenda, provide a map of existing works and case studies, and recommend promising avenues for future research. This will inform the energy policy-making process within the framework of the sustainable development goals objectives and the continuous energy system transformation. Further, the SI will provide a holistic examination of fuel poverty issues and challenges and how they are being addressed by identifying, diagnosing, and tackling these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Theoretical robustness, scientific innovation, and potential policy applicability to energy poverty alleviation are the three major criteria for a paper to be considered for publication. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contributions to this special issue are expected to cover the following topics (but are not limited to):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;- Definition and energy poverty assessment- Exposure and risk to energy poverty: Examining the extent of the energy precariousness and its&lt;br&gt;predominant causal factors&lt;br&gt;- Climate policy and insights into energy poverty&lt;br&gt;- Ambitious climate policy with efforts to reduce energy poverty&lt;br&gt;- Energy poverty eradication in a carbon-constrained world&lt;br&gt;- Socio-economic inequalities in energy poverty before and during the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;br&gt;- Capacity and the energy-poor willingness to pay for improving their housing energy performance&lt;br&gt;- Impact of climate change policy on inequality and energy access&lt;br&gt;- The new era of the energy transition in the building sector&lt;br&gt;- Drivers and barriers of energy consumption and energy efficiency&lt;br&gt;- The role of energy efficiency in enhancing well-being and achieving sustainability goals&lt;br&gt;- Challenges, investment opportunities, financing and technological innovations in energy efficiency&lt;br&gt;- The role of uncertainty in shaping individual preferences for residential energy renovation decision&lt;br&gt;- The cost-effectiveness of energy efficiency implementation measures in the residential sector&lt;br&gt;- Energy poverty, health &amp; welfare benefits of energy efficiency&lt;br&gt;- Investment and individual preference for energy efficiency purchase decisions&lt;br&gt;- Economic Inequality and Household Energy Consumption&lt;br&gt;- Fuel poverty and energy policy: Challenges and solutions&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manuscript submission information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You are invited to submit your manuscript from&lt;strong&gt; Jan 1st, 2023&lt;/strong&gt; until&lt;strong&gt; June 30th, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt;.

Some recent studies suggest that it could become the backbone of electricity production, at least replacing all coal-fired power plants, for example, while others advocate for a non-nuclear future or simply maintaining the nuclear power facilities that currently exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Muellner and the team start by looking at current national energy plans and their projections of future nuclear generating capacity while later considering other scenarios that involve introducing nuclear energy as a way to curb climate change. They also examine the uranium resources that would be required in the next 20 years for different scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To tackle the climate crisis, global warming needs to be limited to well below 2°C as outlined in the &lt;a href=\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement\"&gt;Paris Agreement&lt;/a&gt;, the internationally-agreed treaty adopted in 2015. Sources of energy that rely on fossil fuels therefore need to be substituted as much and as quickly as possible with cleaner alternatives to achieve this goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The most important takeaway from this work, however, is that nuclear power plays a very limited role in mitigating climate change, which is unlikely to change in the future. Using nuclear power is not expected to avoid more than 2 to 3% of total global greenhouse gas emissions annually between 2020 and 2040.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, nuclear power cannot be expanded to become the main source of electricity production in the future due to the amount of uranium that would be needed. Uranium mining would have to increase, which would not be feasible due to limits on production and available reserves in the ground.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The authors also note that current levels of nuclear power production are likely to be maintained by extending the lifetime of existing reactors. However, it is also possible that they will be phased out completely due to their limited climate benefits and the potential for catastrophic accidents that would release radioactive materials. They conclude that ultimately, society will have to decide on these trade-offs.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Article details&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;N.

It also indicates that environmental costs are rarely well-reflected in energy prices, and that the costs of energy transition programmes and related social policies are overwhelmingly borne by electricity consumers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The authors offer four examples of reforms that would rebalance taxes and levies between electricity and heating fuels. These suggestions could drive the changes in energy sources that governments wish to encourage as part of plans to decarbonise energy supplies.&lt;br&gt;An optimum mix of reforms would see higher fossil fuel taxes and lower electricity taxes, reflecting the respective environmental costs, along with a redistribution of levy costs from electricity consumers to taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The reforms would be in line with the basic principle of efficient taxation, allowing prices to reflect all costs related to production, including environmental costs. They would also more effectively allow money raised through general taxation to fund relevant social spending, including subsidies to encourage the desired transition to more environmentally friendly energy supply options.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article details: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Rosenow, J.et al.: “&lt;a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301421522005869\"&gt;Clean heating: Reforming taxes and levies on heating fuels in Europe&lt;/a&gt;,” &lt;em&gt;Energy Policy&lt;/em&gt; (2022)&lt;/p&gt;",

            "description": "&lt;p&gt;FDI occurs when a company or investor buys an interest in a company in another country. It has many significant economic benefits, such as contributing to economic growth, providing employment and spreading the use of advanced technologies. However, there is widespread concern that FDI also has a negative environmental effect because it increases the emission of pollutants such as carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), sulphur dioxide (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and nitrogen oxides (N0&lt;sub&gt;𝑥&lt;/sub&gt;). Nevertheless, the conclusions of published studies vary considerably, both in terms of whether FDI increases or decreases these emissions and in the magnitude of the change.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The review’s authors, &lt;a href=\"https://www.eur.nl/en/people/binyam-afewerk-demena\" title=\"https://www.eur.nl/en/people/binyam-afewerk-demena\"&gt;Binyam Afewerk Demena&lt;/a&gt; from Erasmus University Rotterdam in the Netherlands and &lt;a href=\"https://www.uoguelph.ca/fare/users/safesorg\" title=\"https://www.uoguelph.ca/fare/users/safesorg\"&gt;Sylvanus Kwaku Afesorgbor&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Guelph in Canada, aim to gain a clearer overall picture of the literature by analysing the results from 65 studies. These studies are very heterogeneous in that they vary considerably in terms of the countries studied, the emissions measured and the econometric methods used.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The meta-analysis shows that the underlying effect of FDI on environmental emissions is close to zero. However, after accounting for the heterogeneity of the studies, it indicates that FDI significantly reduces environmental emissions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The authors also note that the impact of FDI is variable, both in a country’s level of development (the reduction of emissions is higher for developed countries) and for the pollutant measured (such as being higher for SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). They thus conclude that a country’s environmental policies should be specific to that country and to the pollutant they are aiming to control.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article details:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Demena, B.A. and Afesorgbor, S.K.: “&lt;a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2019.111192\" title=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2019.111192\"&gt;The effect of FDI on environmental emissions: Evidence from a meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;,” &lt;a href=\"https://www.journals.elsevier.com/energy-policy\" title=\"https://www.journals.elsevier.com/energy-policy\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Energy Policy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (2020)&lt;/p&gt;",

It is estimated that utilising just 20% of the global technical potential of wind power would fulfil the world’s entire energy requirements.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to exploit this potential for future energy policies, research and planning, it is necessary to produce a comprehensive and accurate assessment of potential sites for wind farms at a scale that can assess their limitations, risks and drawbacks as well as potential energy production. An &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2019.06.064\"&gt;article &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;published in Elsevier's journal &lt;em&gt;Energy Policy&lt;/em&gt; does this for onshore wind power in Europe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study by Peter Enevoldsen from the Centre for Energy Technologies at Aarhus University in Denmark, and his colleagues, aims to do this for the continent of Europe. It uses spatial analysis conducted through the geographical information system (GIS) – satellites and public databases relating to electricity, planning and other dimensions – to produce maps incorporating all the constraints. These were of three basic types: infrastructure (roads, waterways, airports and railways), buildings (residential, industrial, etc.), and protected areas (parks, monuments, etc.). The authors acknowledge that not all the land that avoided these constraints would be available to site wind farms, however. For example, land might be privately owned, or assigned for other use, or there might be strong public opposition to building wind farms on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The authors conclude that potential onshore wind energy production in Europe actually exceeds the projected total global energy requirements for 2050. They calculate that there is 52.5 TW of untapped onshore wind power potential in Europe, and especially in some of the larger non-EU countries such as Norway, Russia and Turkey. This figure is higher than previous studies, in part because they incorporate the higher production capacity of current technology, and in part because they are particularly liberal about which land can be used for wind farms. However, they were also using the most accurate and highest resolution data.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article details&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2019.06.064\"&gt;How much wind power potential does Europe have?

Despite concerted efforts to introduce cleaner methods, the transition to clean household fuel remains slow and a huge acceleration will be needed if the UN’s &lt;a href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg7\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg7\"&gt;Sustainable Development Goal 7&lt;/a&gt;, which calls for ‘affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all’, is to be met by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A&lt;a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421520302196\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421520302196\"&gt; new review&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/635/anita-vernekar-shankar\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/635/anita-vernekar-shankar\"&gt;Anita Shankar&lt;/a&gt; of&lt;a href=\"https://www.jhsph.edu/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.jhsph.edu/\"&gt; Johns Hopkins University&lt;/a&gt;, Baltimore, MD, Ashlinn Quinn of the US National Institutes of Health, and colleagues in the US, UK and Mexico from the &lt;a href=\"https://www.fic.nih.gov/About/Staff/Policy-Planning-Evaluation/Pages/clean-cooking-implementation-science-network.aspx\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.fic.nih.gov/About/Staff/Policy-Planning-Evaluation/Pages/clean-cooking-implementation-science-network.aspx\"&gt;Clean Cooking Implementation Science Network&lt;/a&gt; discusses case studies from Africa and sub-Saharan Africa; sets out the main reasons why reducing pollution from cooking is proving so difficult; and offers a blueprint for overcoming these barriers. This is published in the Elsevier journal &lt;a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-policy\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-policy\"&gt;Energy Policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Numerous programmes to roll out clean fuels, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), into poor homes have met with only partial success; the householders adopt new fuels alongside established, more polluting methods. This phenomenon, in which a novel cooking technology is simply added to the traditional ones, is known as ‘stove stacking’ and it is ubiquitous. The same thing occurs in richer households whenever a microwave or slow cooker is added to the existing repertoire of kitchen equipment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Shankar, Quinn and their co-authors set out economic, behavioural and cultural reasons why, in the low-income context, cleaner devices and fuels are ‘stacked’ on top of more polluting ones. It is sometimes a simple matter of cost, but wood stoves, for instance, often remain in use even when incomes rise or the cost of cleaner fuels plummets. Depending on the setting, other reasons include excessive travel time to obtain clean fuel (e.g. to exchange LPG cylinders), stoves that were ill-suited to larger cooking volumes and/or specific cooking tasks, and the secondary room-heating advantage of wood burning.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Given the reality of stove stacking, the authors propose seven principles for ‘clean stack design’ and policy focused on discontinuation of traditional stove use and a shift towards ‘cleaner stacks’ of fuels and cooking devices. The aim is to enable households to transition away from polluting fuels and practices and reduce exposure to air pollution in the home and nearby environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article details:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shankar, A.V. et al.

Firstly, its membership structure which is tied to that of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.oecd.org/\"&gt;OECD&lt;/a&gt; looks increasingly old-fashioned. The BRIC nations of Brazil, Russia, India and China are all now in the top 10 energy-consuming countries, but they are not in the OECD and, therefore, not entitled to join the IEA. Secondly, a mandate narrowly focused on oil security seems both outdated and short-sighted in view of the threat of climate change and the need for a transition to clean energy sources. And thirdly, the field is becoming crowded with an ‘alphabet soup’ of newer international organisations focusing on energy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The strategy that the IEA has drawn up to survive and thrive in this new world has four strands. It is reaching out to prominent emerging economies by enrolling ‘association members’ and broadening its reach to include renewable energy and energy efficiency. The other two strands involve acting assertively to defend its territory from ‘invasion’ by newer organisations, while working more closely with large international organisations outside energy, particularly the &lt;a href=\"https://g20.org/en/Pages/home.aspx\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://g20.org/en/Pages/home.aspx\"&gt;G20&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The initial success of these strategies underlines the fact that organisations like the IEA are able to employ a certain amount of strategic independence from their member states and that this can help them thrive. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article details&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Downie, C.: &lt;a href=\"http://nonsolus/st@r/admin/tasks/Strategies%20for%20Survival:%20The%20International%20Energy%20Agency%E2%80%99s%20response%20to%20a%20new%20world.%20Energy%20Policy\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http://nonsolus/st@r/admin/tasks/Strategies%20for%20Survival:%20The%20International%20Energy%20Agency%E2%80%99s%20response%20to%20a%20new%20world.%20Energy%20Policy\"&gt;Strategies for Survival: The International Energy Agency’s response to a new world.

These figures are mirrored by fuel consumption changes in small trucks. However, transferring these lab figures to real on-road fuel savings has been a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Real-world improvements are gradual as new, more efficient vehicles replace older, less efficient ones. The paper’s authors, based at the &lt;a href=\"https://www.utk.edu/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.utk.edu/\"&gt;University of Tennessee &lt;/a&gt;and the US&lt;a href=\"https://www.nrel.gov/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.nrel.gov/\"&gt; National Renewable Energy Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;, also had to consider actual on-road conditions. When these two factors were taken into account, adjusted fuel economy gains closely matched estimates by the Federal Highway Administration based on traffic counts and motor fuel tax records. The researchers were able to show that mpg gains on regulatory tests have led to proportional on-road improvements. The study also revealed that changes in driver behaviour due to improved fuel economy of vehicles had little effect on fuel savings. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The adjusted fuel savings of two trillion gallons of fuel between 1975 and 2018 exceeds the total fuel use of all US light-duty vehicles (cars and small trucks) from 2004 to 2018, the authors noted. And the reduction of 17 trillion tonnes of CO2 emissions is more than all US gross CO2 emissions from all sources between 2016 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, the team estimates that, over the 43 years investigated, four-fifths of fuel savings are due to improved fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards. Only one-fifth of savings can be attributed to gasoline price increases.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article details:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Greene, D.L., Sims, C.B., Muratori, M.: “&lt;a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301421520302627?via%3Dihub\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301421520302627?via%3Dihub\"&gt;Two trillion gallons: Fuel savings from fuel economy improvements to US light-duty vehicles, 1975-2018&lt;/a&gt;,” Energy Policy (2020).&lt;/p&gt;",

They lay out recommendations for taking “a more harmonised approach” to scenarios for decarbonisation that will improve “consistency and transparency”.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In 2011, the European Commission published a &lt;a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/sites/clima/files/strategies/2050/docs/roadmap_fact_sheet_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/sites/clima/files/strategies/2050/docs/roadmap_fact_sheet_en.pdf\"&gt;Roadmap for moving to a competitive low carbon economy in 2050&lt;/a&gt;. The roadmap states that “The EU should achieve an overall 80% reduction in domestic emissions by 2050. To achieve this long-term target cost-efficiently, the EU should reduce its domestic emissions by 40% and 60% by 2030 and 2040, respectively.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The team’s framework has been designed to compare and measure how countries are progressing towards these targets. It is based on ten assessment characteristics, including ambitiousness of targets, relations with other (European) countries, and stakeholder involvement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To evaluate current progress, the researchers looked at six north-west European countries: the Netherlands, Germany, France, Denmark, the UK and Belgium. They found different levels of progress and note that development is still “spontaneous and disjointed”. In response, the authors present concrete proposals for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To achieve the 2050 targets, countries need to use “long-term thinking”; they need to design clear policies and energy scenarios with specific aims. Key to success are “collaboration and joint efforts”. EU countries, the researchers point out, have close socio-economic relationships and climate change is a global concern, therefore, “scenarios cannot be isolated”.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The researchers also recommend an “interactive” approach to policymaking that includes government, business, academia, NGOs and the public. Further, non-technological solutions, such as encouraging lifestyle changes, should also be embraced.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Climate change is one of the 21st century’s most pressing challenges, monitoring and assessing what countries are doing about it is key to the success, or otherwise, of the world’s response.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article details:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Mikova, N., et al.: \"&lt;a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421519302204?via%3Dihub#!\" target=\"_blank\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421519302204?via%3Dihub#!\"&gt;Low-carbon energy scenarios 2050 in north-west European countries: Towards a more harmonised approach to achieve the EU targets&lt;/a&gt;,\" &lt;em&gt;Energy Policy&lt;/em&gt; (2019).&lt;/p&gt;",

It is quite likely they are not fuel poor as their home is small and relatively energy efficient (as required by law). But by targeting energy efficiency schemes based on deprivation, this home may receive insulation it doesn’t need, instead of support for tackling the root causes of deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Marchand and his team measured the correlation between energy poverty and overall deprivation on a district by district level, restricting their analysis to England. Two numerical values were obtained for each of over 32,000 Lower Super Output Areas (LSOA) in England, each representing roughly 1500 individuals. Data on overall deprivation came from an Index of Multiple Deprivation published in 2010, and on energy poverty from the UK Government's own statistics published in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Correlating these together showed that the two datasets were essentially independent: some areas with little overall deprivation had high levels of energy poverty, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The researchers used this data to construct a matrix of energy poverty versus overall deprivation in which each LSOA was put into one of 25 categories depending on its position on the two scales. They proposed that using this to tailor interventions such as winter fuel payments would be more effective than using deprivation as a proxy for energy poverty.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article details:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Marchand, R. et al.

In this article, researchers based at Massachusetts Institute of Technology carry out a detailed analysis of the reasons behind this cost reduction.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Amid so much bad news about climate change, it is easy to miss positive developments. Among these is the rapidly growing popularity of one of the 'cleanest' of all energy sources: photovoltaic solar modules. The surge in popularity has been accompanied by a rapid reduction in the cost of this technology, but the reasons for this were unclear. &lt;u&gt;&lt;a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"http://trancik.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http://trancik.mit.edu/\"&gt;Jessika Trancik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; and her co-workers at &lt;u&gt;&lt;a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://idss.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://idss.mit.edu/\"&gt;Massachusetts Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, USA carried out a detailed analysis of the reasons behind this cost reduction. Their paper, '&lt;u&gt;&lt;a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421518305196\" target=\"_blank\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421518305196\"&gt;Evaluating the causes of cost reduction in photovoltaic modules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;,' was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Energy Policy&lt;/em&gt; in December 2018.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By developing a new mathematical model, the group found that energy conversion efficiency was the most important low-level driver of cost reduction between 1980 and 2001, but that manufacturing plant size became most important after 2001. Research and development (R&amp;D) and – in the later period – economies of scale have been the most important high-level factors. These mechanisms were enabled by public R&amp;D and policies that stimulate market growth. This research suggests that continuing public R&amp;D, as well as market-stimulating policies, can help support cost reductions going forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To reach these conclusions, the researchers divided the factors involved in cost reduction into two categories: high- and low-level. Low-level mechanisms explain the changes in solar module costs directly due to changes in the cost of silicon and other raw materials, plant size, yield and energy conversion efficiency. High-level mechanisms can be thought of as the drivers of low-level mechanisms and include public and private R&amp;D investment, 'learning by doing' and economies of scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The team hope their work will be useful in supporting further cost reductions in the decades to come. This will be essential if solar energy is to play a full part in the zero-carbon fuel environment that is needed to mitigate the worst effects of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;",

They describe their work as being anchored in “institutional theory”, and focused on a problem of vocabulary rather than of science itself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The problems the authors discuss are not based on criticism of the specific energy generation methods commonly described as “renewable”, but rather on how use of that term can hide the complexities of alternative policy options.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Harjanne acknowledges climate change as “the most pressing issue of our time.” He concludes, however, that the way the term “renewables” is used in language does not promote best understanding of the various solutions and their respective merits and disadvantages.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The authors’ argument centres on the great diversity of renewable energy sources, leading to the conclusion that lumping all renewable technologies together can limit the more valuable comparisons of the benefits and disadvantages of different energy generation methods in different situations.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They suggest that if a technology can be described as renewable, that may shut down deeper analysis of how appropriate it actually is in any given circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Linking their analysis to &lt;u&gt;&lt;a rel=\"noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"sustainability\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability\"&gt;sustainability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, the other key buzzword in the field, the authors argue that renewable does not necessarily mean sustainable. They point out, for example, that burning biomass to generate electricity may be sustainable in a small-scale local context but unsustainable in terms of the land use required to grow biomass on a large scale. Similarly, hydro-electric power generation can also have severe negative environmental impacts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Adverse impacts of other renewable energy sources, including geothermal, wind and solar energy, are also considered.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“Rather than focussing on renewables, we should be looking at the actual measurable impacts of each technology,” says Harjanne. Such impacts include the level of carbon dioxide and other emissions, and the energy expended in creating the required technologies, such as wind turbines, solar panels or hydro-electric dams.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In place of what they consider the over-generalised use of the term “renewables”, Harjanne and Korhonen offer an alternative model that categorises energy generation systems according to their overall effect, focusing especially on the carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They present their model in a diagram they call a “carbon-combustion quadrant”. This emphasises low carbon content in the energy generating process and the lowest possible levels of combustion as the two key favourable factors for any technology.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The researchers claim that their alternative analysis is a much more subtle and useful approach than just decreeing that renewables are good and everything else is bad.&lt;/p&gt;",

A consequent fall in the share values of international oil companies may affect pensions, small investments, and even the stability of the financial system. It is reasoned that this justifies policy intervention, to provide more information to small investors.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tHowever, economist Robert Cairns at McGill University in Canada suggests in his article,&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421518304208\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Stranded oil of Erewhon&lt;/a&gt;, published in the journal&nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/energy-policy\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Energy Policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;(October 2018), that the technology of oil extraction and the options available to oil companies mean there is little basis for this concern. (Erewhon is a satirical, 19-century novel by Samuel Butler that takes place in the topsy-turvy land of Erewhon &ndash; which is &lsquo;Nowhere&rsquo; spelt, nearly exactly, backwards.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tBoth exploration and development in the oil industry are highly sensitive to its current price and to anticipations about future prices, with investments only made if there is good reason to expect that they will be profitable. The assets sunk in the oil industry have only limited susceptibility to stranding because of a feature particular to the industry &ndash; the natural decline of production from a well.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tBy the time a climate policy is introduced, much of the value from developed reserves will have been paid back. Moreover, those reserves will remain competitive against new developments, which must be expected to pay back their newly incurred sunk costs.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tThe transition may well be orderly, since comparable challenges in 2008 and 2014 have not given rise to stranded assets. Producers are now limiting attention to the most profitable opportunities for investment, and less profitable ones may never be developed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tTo the extent that oil companies are vulnerable to stranding, some of that vulnerability may already be discounted into the price of their shares. There is no reason to suppose that the market is not adequately pricing the risk of climatic action.&lt;/p&gt;",

Therefore the Energy Modeling Forum at Stanford University has developed a structured risk assessment framework, and evaluated the likelihood of one or more foreign oil disruptions over the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tThe new study,&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2017.12.013\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;An updated assessment of oil market disruption risks&lt;/a&gt;, was recently published in the journal&nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.journals.elsevier.com/energy-policy\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Energy Policy&lt;/a&gt;, as part of a Virtual Special Issue on &lsquo;Oil Supply Disruptions, US Economic Activity and Oil Security&rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tLeading geopolitical, military and oil-market experts provided their expertise on the probability of different events occurring, and their corresponding link to major supply disruptions in key oil market regions. This panel concluded that current world events and energy markets have increased the likelihood of oil disruptions since 1996, but their combined judgment indicated a risk profile similar to the 2005 period. Moreover, their assessments indicate that lower oil price paths make net disruptions of any given size more likely.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tThe study evaluated five primary production regions: Saudi Arabia, Other Persian Gulf, Africa, Latin America, and Russian/Caspian States. Disruptions are defined as being net of offsets (e.g. OPEC spare capacity), with the notable exception that the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) and other global emergency petroleum stocks are not included as a source of offsets.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tAt least once during the 10-year time frame (2016&ndash;2025), there exists an approximately 80% probability of a net (of offsets) disruption of 2 million barrels per day or more lasting at least one month. While shorter disruptions are more likely, the framework captured longer duration disruptions of 6&ndash;18 months, and very long disruptions lasting longer than 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;\r\n\tThe article describes its approach to oil market disruption risk assessments in considerable detail, to allow others to grasp some of the benefits and challenges of adopting such a formal, structured evaluation of expert judgment. Additional studies applied more frequently would augment our understanding of oil supply risks, and could provide continuously updated insights for selecting appropriate strategies.&lt;/p&gt;",
